Analysis Results - path11
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &c
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `a` may be assigned the address of `c` through the function `foo`, leading to potential aliasing.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` and `&d` may be assigned to the same location through indirect assignments in the function `foo`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &d
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `a` may be assigned the address of `d` through indirect assignments in the function `foo`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: b and &c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers b and &c are initialized in separate branches of the conditional statement, ensuring they never point to the same memory location.

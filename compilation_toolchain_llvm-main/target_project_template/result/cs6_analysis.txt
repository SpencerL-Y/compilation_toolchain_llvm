Analysis Results - cs6
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a1 and b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `g = q` and then `*p = g`, which means `*a = b` after the function call, potentially making `a1` and `b` point to the same location.

Analysis Results - struct-incompab-typecast-nested
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: pdst->f1[9] and &x
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer pdst->f1[9] is part of an array, and since array indices are dynamic and uncertain at runtime, pdst->f1[9] may alias with any element of the array, including pdst->f1[3], which is directly assigned the address of x.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: pdst->f3[3].in2 and &y
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to runtime index uncertainty, and pdst is assigned from psrc, which points to the same struct instance.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: psrc->f1[2] and &z
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer psrc->f1[2] is never assigned to point to the address of z, and different struct fields (f1 and f3) never alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: psrc->f3[1].in2 and &z
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer pdst->f3[1].in2 is assigned the address of &z, and since pdst is assigned from psrc, psrc->f3[1].in2 may also point to &z due to the conservative handling of array indices and struct fields.

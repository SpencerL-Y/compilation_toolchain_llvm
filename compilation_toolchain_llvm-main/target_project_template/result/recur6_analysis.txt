Analysis Results - recur6
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and &z
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the recursive function `f`, `x` may be assigned the address of `z` in one execution path, leading to potential aliasing.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional execution paths in function `f`, `x` may be assigned the address of `y` or `z`, leading to potential aliasing with `&y`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and &z
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional execution and reassignment of x to both &y and &z within the function f(), x may point to &z depending on the execution path taken.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional assignment of `x` to `&y` and `&z` within the function `f()`, and the recursive nature of `f()`, `x` may point to `&y` depending on the execution path taken.

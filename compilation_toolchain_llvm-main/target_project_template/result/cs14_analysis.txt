Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and &a
Ground Truth: MAY

--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and &b
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, x may be assigned the address of either &a or &b, leading to potential aliasing with &b.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and &c
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer x is assigned to the address of either &a or &b based on the condition involving c, and later reassigned to &c. However, at no point is x assigned to &c before the reassignment, ensuring they never point to the same location simultaneously.
--------------------------------------------------

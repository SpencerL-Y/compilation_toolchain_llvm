Analysis Results - recur3
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: y and &x
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y is assigned the address of either x or z through the double pointer m, depending on the execution path taken in function f, making y potentially point to x.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: y and &z
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y is assigned the address of either x or z depending on the execution path in function f, leading to a potential alias with &z.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: y and &z
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y is assigned the address of either x or z depending on the execution path, and since the execution path is determined by the runtime value of x, y may point to the same location as &z.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: y and &x
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y may be assigned the address of x through the indirect assignment *m = &x in function f, depending on the execution path taken.

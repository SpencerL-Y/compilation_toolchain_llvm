Analysis Results - struct-field-multi-dereference
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: q->f2->f1 and &x
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both q and p point to the same struct instance ms1, and ms1.f2 points to ms2, where ms2.f1 is directly assigned the address of x, making q->f2->f1 and &x point to the same location.

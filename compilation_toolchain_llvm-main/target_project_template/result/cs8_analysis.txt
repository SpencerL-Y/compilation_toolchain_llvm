Analysis Results - cs8
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and &obj1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `x` may be assigned the address of `obj1` through the function `foo`, which assigns `&obj1` to the dereferenced pointer `*p`, and `a` could point to `x` if the `if` condition is true.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: z and &obj1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `z` may be assigned to `*a` in `foo`, which is then set to point to `&obj1`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: y and &obj2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, y may be assigned the address of obj2 through indirect assignments in the function foo.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: z and &obj2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, z may be assigned the address of &obj2 through indirect assignments in the function foo.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 5
Pointers: x and &obj2
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer x is assigned the address of obj1 through the indirect assignment in the function foo, while &obj2 is a direct reference to obj2, and there are no assignments or paths that make x point to obj2.

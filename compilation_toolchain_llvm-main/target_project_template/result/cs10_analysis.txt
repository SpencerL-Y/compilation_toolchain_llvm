==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: b and &obj
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns the address of `obj` to the location pointed to by `*q`, which can be `b` depending on the execution path.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: e and d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, both pointers e and d may be assigned the address of the same memory location through indirect assignments in the function foo.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: e and &obj
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `e` is assigned the address of `d` in one execution path, and `d` is assigned the address of `obj` through the function `foo`, making it possible for `e` to point to `obj`.

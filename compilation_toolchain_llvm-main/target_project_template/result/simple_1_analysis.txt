Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the direct assignment `p = q` at LABEL 1, pointers p and q are guaranteed to point to the same memory location, hence they MUST alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the direct assignment `p = q` at LABEL 1, both pointers are guaranteed to point to the same memory location, making them must-alias.

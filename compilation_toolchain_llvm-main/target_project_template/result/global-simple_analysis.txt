Analysis Results - global-simple
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: *qq_int and q_int
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: The pointer q_int is directly assigned from p_int, and qq_int is directly assigned from pp_int, which points to p_int. Therefore, *qq_int and q_int both point to the same memory location as p_int, resulting in a must-alias relationship.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: q_int and &a_int
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: q_int is assigned the value of p_int, which is initialized to point to a_int, so q_int may point to the same location as &a_int.

Analysis Results - struct-nested-array3
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: &p->out4 and &s.out4
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the assignment p = &s, the pointer p points to the same memory location as s, making &p->out4 and &s.out4 point to the same address.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: &p->out3.mid2[10].in1[10] and &s.out3.mid2[4000]
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to uncertain runtime indices, and same fields in different struct array elements may alias under conservative analysis.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: &p->out3.mid2[20] and &p->out3.mid2[30]
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to runtime uncertainty in index values.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: &p->out3.mid2[3].in3 and &s.out3.mid3[2]
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias, and &p->out3.mid2[3].in3 and &s.out3.mid3[2] access different fields within the struct ArrayStruct.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 5
Pointers: &p->out3.mid2[0] and &s.out4
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias, and &p->out3.mid2[0] and &s.out4 refer to different fields within the struct.

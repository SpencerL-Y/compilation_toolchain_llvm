Analysis Results - path13
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: c and &f
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `c` may be assigned to `a->i` and subsequently point to the same location as `b`, which is assigned the address of `f`. Thus, `c` and `&f` may alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: d and &w
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers d and &w are assigned to different variables in mutually exclusive branches of the if-else statement, ensuring they never point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: c and &w
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `c` and `&w` may both be assigned to `*(a->i)`, leading to potential aliasing.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: d and &f
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers d and &f never point to the same memory location as d is assigned to a->i in the else branch, while &f is a direct address of a local variable f, and there is no assignment or operation that could make them alias.

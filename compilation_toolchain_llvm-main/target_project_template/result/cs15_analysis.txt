Analysis Results - cs15
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a1 and &d1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `*y = z` and `*w = t`, where `y` and `w` are `c` and `a` respectively, and `z` is `d`. Since `c` and `b` point to the same location (`b1`), `*c` and `*b` may alias. Thus, `a1` (pointed by `a`) and `&d1` (pointed by `d`) may alias due to the indirect assignments through `foo`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b1 and a1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both b1 and a1 are indirectly assigned the value of the same pointer d through the function calls, which could potentially make them point to the same memory location.

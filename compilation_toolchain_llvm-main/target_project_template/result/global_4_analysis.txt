Analysis Results - global_4
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: b and w
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `Zulu` assigns `*p` to `q` and then to `obj`, which means `b` (pointed by `*p`) could potentially point to the same location as `w` (pointed by `q`) or to `obj`, making `b` and `w` potentially alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &g
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `b` is assigned the value of `*p` in function `Zulu`, and `*p` is set to `obj`, which points to `&g`. Therefore, `b` may point to `&g` after the function call.

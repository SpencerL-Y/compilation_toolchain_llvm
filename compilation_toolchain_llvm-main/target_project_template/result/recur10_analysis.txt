Analysis Results - recur10
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `*p` is assigned the address of `y` within the function `f`, and since `p` points to `x`, `x` may point to `y` during the execution of `f`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and &z
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the recursive function `f()`, `*p` can be assigned the address of either `y` or `z`, and since `p` initially points to `x`, `x` may end up pointing to `z` through indirect assignments.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `p` is assigned the address of `x`, and then conditionally, `*p` is assigned the address of `y`, making `x` and `&y` potentially point to the same location through `p`.

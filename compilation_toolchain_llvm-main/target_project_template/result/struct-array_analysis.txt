Analysis Results - struct-array
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: &p->f3[10] and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to unknown runtime indices, and q points to an element of the same array.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: &p->f3[20] and &p->f3[30]
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to dynamic index resolution at runtime.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: &s.f3[0] and &s.f3[99]
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Array elements with different indices may alias due to dynamic index access at runtime.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: &p->f3[0] and &s.f4
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias due to field sensitivity.
--------------------------------------------------

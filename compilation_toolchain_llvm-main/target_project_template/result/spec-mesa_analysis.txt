==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `q` is conditionally assigned the value of `r` if `p` is non-null, creating a potential alias between `p` and `q` depending on the runtime condition.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: After the call to `(*POINTER_OP[CC->API].Begin)(p, q);`, if `p` is non-null, `q` is assigned the value of `r`, which could potentially be the same as `p` depending on the input to `draw`, leading to a possible aliasing scenario.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointers p and q are passed to the function `draw`, where q is conditionally assigned the value of r if p is non-null, creating a potential aliasing situation.

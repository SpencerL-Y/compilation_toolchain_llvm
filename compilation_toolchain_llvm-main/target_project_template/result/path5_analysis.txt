Analysis Results - path5
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: obj1.pi and &k1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, obj1.pi may be assigned the address of &k1, leading to potential aliasing.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: obj1.pi and &k2
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, obj1.pi may be assigned the address of &k2 through the pointer s, which is conditionally assigned to either &k1 or &k2.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: obj2.pi and &k2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, both obj2.pi and &k2 may be assigned the same address through the pointer s, which is conditionally assigned to either &k1 or &k2.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: obj2.pi and &k1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `s` can point to either `&k1` or `&k2`, and since `b->pi` is assigned `s`, `obj2.pi` may point to `&k1`.

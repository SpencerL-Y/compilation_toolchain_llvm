Analysis Results - heap-linkedlist
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p_data1 and p_data2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both p_data1 and p_data2 are assigned to the same field (p->data) of different struct instances within a loop, so they may alias due to potential reuse of memory locations by malloc.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: p_next and p_data1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: p_next and p_data1 are assigned to different struct fields (next and data) within the Node structure, and different struct fields never alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: head->next->data and head->next->next
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointers head->next->data and head->next->next may alias because they are fields within different instances of the struct Node, and the allocation and assignment patterns in the loop create potential aliasing scenarios.
--------------------------------------------------

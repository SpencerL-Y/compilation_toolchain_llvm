==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `a` is assigned the address of `obj` in `foo`, but `bar` subsequently assigns the address of `b` to the same location `a` points to, making `a` potentially point to `b`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: a and &obj
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `a` is assigned the address of `obj` through the function `foo`, but `a` is later reassigned the address of `b` through the function `bar`, making it possible but not certain that `a` points to `obj`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: c and &b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `c` is assigned through `foo`, which calls `bar` that assigns `&b` to the dereferenced pointer, creating a potential alias between `c` and `&b`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: c and &obj
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer c is assigned the address of b through the function foo, which calls bar, changing the target to b, while &obj is a distinct memory location.

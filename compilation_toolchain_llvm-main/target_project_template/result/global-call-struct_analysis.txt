Analysis Results - global-call-struct
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: In the function `bar`, both `*pp` and `*qq` are assigned the address of `x`, making `p` and `q` point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: global.f2 and *qq
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer *qq is assigned the address of x in function bar, which is the same address stored in global.f2, but since the program could be modified to call foo instead of bar, *qq could also be assigned the address of y. Thus, *qq may point to the same location as global.f2, but it is not guaranteed.

==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &c
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned the address of `c` through `q`, leading to `a` potentially pointing to the same location as `&c`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` and `&d` may point to the same location if `*p = q` assigns `q` (which could be `&d`) to `*p` (which could be `b`).
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &d
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned `q`, which may point to `&d`, leading `a` to potentially alias with `&d`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: b and &c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `q`, which could be `&c` if the first conditional block is executed.

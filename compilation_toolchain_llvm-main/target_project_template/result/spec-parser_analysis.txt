==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: sentence[0].string and c1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer `sentence[0].string` is part of the `Word` struct array and is initialized in the `special_string` function, while `c1` is a pointer to a `Clause` struct initialized in the `build_clause` function; they belong to different data structures and fields, which never alias.

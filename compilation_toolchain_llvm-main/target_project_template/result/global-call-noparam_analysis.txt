Analysis Results - global-call-noparam
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: After the assignment `q = p;` in `main`, `p` and `q` must alias. However, `p` is later reassigned to point to `&c`, while `q` is not updated, leading to a potential aliasing scenario depending on the execution path. Thus, `p` and `q` may alias.

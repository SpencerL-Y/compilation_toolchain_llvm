Analysis Results - cs20
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: b and &d
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `Zulu` assigns `*p = q`, which means `b` and `&d` could potentially point to the same location after the function call, depending on the execution path and parameter values.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `Zulu` assigns the value of `q` to the location pointed by `p`, which means `b` and `&c` could potentially point to the same address after the function calls in `Xray` and `Yank`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &c
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function Zulu assigns the address of q to the location pointed by p, making the pointers passed to Zulu potentially alias. Since Yank() passes &a and &c to Zulu, a and &c may alias after the function call.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: a and &d
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function Zulu assigns the address of `q` to the location pointed by `p`, and since `Xray` and `Yank` both call `Zulu` with different arguments, `a` and `&d` may point to the same location depending on the execution path.

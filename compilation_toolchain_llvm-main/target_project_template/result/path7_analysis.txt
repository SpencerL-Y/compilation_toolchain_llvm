Analysis Results - path7
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: b and &e
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` and `&e` may point to the same location because `*p = q` can assign `q` (which could be `&e`) to `b` if `p` is set to `&b`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: c and &d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned to point to `q`, which may point to `&d`, leading `c` to potentially alias with `&d`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: c and &e
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q`, `*p` could potentially be assigned to `&e`, leading to `c` and `&e` possibly pointing to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: b and &d
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q`, `b` and `&d` may alias if the condition `d` is true, leading `p` to point to `b` and `q` to point to `&d`, which is then assigned to `*p`.

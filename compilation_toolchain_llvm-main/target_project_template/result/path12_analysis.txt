Analysis Results - path12
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: c and &obj
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `c` may be assigned to `*x` and `&obj` may be assigned to `*y`, and since `*x = *y` in `foo`, `c` and `&obj` may alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: d and &t
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Pointer `d` is initialized to the address of `obj`, while `&t` is the address of `t`; these are distinct memory locations, and no assignments or operations in the program change this relationship.

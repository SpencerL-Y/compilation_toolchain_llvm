Analysis Results - cs12
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &obj
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `a` is assigned the address of `obj` through the indirect assignment `*p = ADDRESS_OF[&obj]` in the function `foo`, which is called with `x` pointing to `a`. However, after LABEL 1, `x` is reassigned to point to `c`, but `y` still points to `b`, and `foo` is called again. Since `a` could still hold the address of `obj` from the first call to `foo`, `a` and `&obj` may alias.

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: c and &obj
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: After the call to foo with x pointing to &c, the function assigns the address of obj to *x, which means c may point to obj.

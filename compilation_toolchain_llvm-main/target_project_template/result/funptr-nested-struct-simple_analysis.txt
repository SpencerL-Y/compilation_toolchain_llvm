Analysis Results - funptr-nested-struct-simple
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: void* and void*
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointers f1 and f2 in the struct 'interesting' may point to the same function, and both are invoked with the address of 'g', leading to potential aliasing of the pointers passed to these functions.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: a and &g
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointers f1 and f2 in the struct `interesting` are invoked with the address of `g`, and since the exact behavior of these functions is unknown, they may modify or use the address of `g`, leading to potential aliasing with any pointer `a` that could be affected by these function calls.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &g
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Pointer 'a' is not defined in the given program, and '&g' is a direct address of the global variable 'g', which is never assigned to any other pointer.

Analysis Results - recur4
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: y and &z
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y is assigned the address of a local variable k, but if the condition (z) is true, *p (which is y) is assigned the address of z, creating a potential alias between y and &z.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: y and &k
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointer y is reassigned to point to the address of k within the function f, but since k is a local variable, y and &k cannot alias outside the scope of f.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: y and &z
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `y` is assigned the address of `k`, but within the function `f`, if the condition `z` is true, `*p` (which is `y` due to `x = &y`) is assigned the address of `z`. Therefore, `y` may point to `z` depending on the execution path.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: y and &k
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer y is assigned the address of k, but within the function f, y is reassigned to point to the address of k. However, due to the recursive call and conditional assignment of *p, y may also point to the address of z, creating a potential aliasing scenario.

Analysis Results - struct_2
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s1.f1 and s1.f2
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias due to field sensitivity.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: s1.f1 and s2.f1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Initially, s1.f1 points to &x and s2.f1 points to &y, but after the assignment at LABEL 3, s1.f1 is updated to point to &y, which is the same as s2.f1, creating a potential aliasing scenario.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: s1.f1 and s2.f1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Initially, s1.f1 points to &x and s2.f1 points to &y, but after the assignment at LABEL 3, s1.f1 is updated to point to &y, which is the same as s2.f1. Thus, s1.f1 and s2.f1 may alias depending on the execution path.

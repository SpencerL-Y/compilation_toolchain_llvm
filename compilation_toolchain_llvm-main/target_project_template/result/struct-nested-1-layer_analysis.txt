Analysis Results - struct-nested-1-layer
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: pms2->f4 and pms1->f2.f3
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields (f4 and f3) never alias due to field sensitivity.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: pms2->f3 and pms1->f2.f3
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pointers are initialized to point to the same field `f3` of the same struct instance `ms.f2`, making them always point to the same memory location.

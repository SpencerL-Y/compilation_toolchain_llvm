Analysis Results - cs16
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and b
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Each call to `foo` results in `a`, `b`, and `c` being assigned distinct memory locations returned by separate `alloc` calls, ensuring they never point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both pointers b and c are assigned memory locations returned by the alloc function through the foo function, which uses malloc. Since malloc can return the same memory location on different calls if the memory is reused, b and c may potentially point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns a newly allocated memory location to each pointer passed to it, and since `alloc` always returns a new memory location, `a` and `c` may alias if `malloc` returns the same address due to memory reuse or allocation patterns.

Analysis Results - funptr-nested-struct
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: void* and void*
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointers `f1` and `f2` in the `struct interesting` instance `i1` are both invoked with the address of `g`. Since both function pointers are assigned to the same struct instance and are called with the same argument, they may potentially point to the same function or memory location, depending on the runtime behavior and function definitions.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: a and &g
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointers f1 and f2 in the struct interesting are invoked with the address of g, and since the exact behavior of f1 and f2 is unknown, they may modify or use the address of g, leading to potential aliasing with any pointer a that is manipulated within these functions.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &g
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointers f1 and f2 in the struct interesting are invoked with the address of g, and since the exact behavior of these functions is unknown, they may modify or use the address of g, leading to potential aliasing with any pointer they manipulate.

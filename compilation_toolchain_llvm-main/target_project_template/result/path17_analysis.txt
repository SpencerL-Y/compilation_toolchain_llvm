==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, the pointer `p` may point to `a` or `b`, and `q` may point to `c` or `d`. If `p` points to `a` and `q` points to `d`, then `*p = q` assigns `&d` to `a`, creating a potential alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: a and &c
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, pointer `a` may be assigned the address of `c` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` when `p` points to `a` and `q` points to `c`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: b and &d
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `d` through indirect assignment via `p` and `q`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: b and &c
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `c` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` when `p` is set to `&b` and `q` is set to `&c`.

Analysis Results - funptr-simple
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: In the first execution path, both pointers `p` and `q` are assigned the address of `x`, leading to a MUST alias. In the second execution path, `p` is assigned the address of `x` and `q` is assigned the address of `y`, leading to a NO alias. Considering both paths, `p` and `q` MAY alias.

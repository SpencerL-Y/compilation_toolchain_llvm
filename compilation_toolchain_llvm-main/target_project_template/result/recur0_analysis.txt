Analysis Results - recur0
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the recursive function `f()`, there are execution paths where `x` is assigned the address of `y` before the function returns, creating a potential aliasing situation.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and &z
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the recursive nature of function `f`, `x` may be assigned the address of `z` at LABEL 2, and since the function can be called multiple times, `x` could potentially point to `z` at some point during execution.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the recursive nature of function `f`, there is a path where `x` is assigned the address of `y` before the function returns, allowing `x` to potentially point to `y`.

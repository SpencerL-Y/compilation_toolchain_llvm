Analysis Results - int2pointer
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Pointer `p` is assigned the address of `ms.f1`, and `q` is calculated by adding 1 to the integer representation of `p`. Since `q` is derived from `p` but offset by an integer, they may point to adjacent memory locations, and due to the uncertainty in pointer arithmetic, they may alias.

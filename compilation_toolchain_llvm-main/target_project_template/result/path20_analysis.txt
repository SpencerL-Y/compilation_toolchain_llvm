Analysis Results - path20
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: obj and &q
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: The assignment *a = ADDRESS_OF[&q] ensures that *b, which is aliased with *a, points to &q, and since obj is assigned the value of *b, obj must point to &q.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: obj and &r
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to conditional assignments and the reassignment of `a` to `b`, `obj` may point to `&r` depending on the execution path taken.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: obj and &w
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `obj` may point to `&w` if the `else` branch is taken, where `a` is assigned the address of `g`, and `g` is assigned the address of `w`. Since `a` is then assigned to `b`, and `*a` is assigned the address of `q`, `obj` is assigned `*b`, which could be `&w` if the `else` path is taken.

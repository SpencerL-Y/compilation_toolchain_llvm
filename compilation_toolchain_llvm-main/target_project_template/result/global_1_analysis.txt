Analysis Results - global_1
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: *pp and *qq
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: After `bar()` executes, `q` is assigned the address of `x`, and since `qq` points to `q`, `*qq` may point to `x`. Meanwhile, `pp` points to `p`, which initially points to `x`, so `*pp` may also point to `x`. Thus, `*pp` and `*qq` may alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: *pp and *qq
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: After `bar()` executes, `q` is assigned the address of `x`, making `*qq` potentially point to `x`, while `*pp` always points to `x` through `p`, leading to a potential aliasing scenario.

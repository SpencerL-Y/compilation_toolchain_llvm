==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and &ss
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `k` in function `foo` is initially set to point to `&ss`, and then it is assigned to point to `x`, which can be either `a` or `b` depending on the call. Therefore, `a` and `&ss` may alias if `foo` is called with `a` as the argument.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &ss
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `k` in function `foo` is initially pointing to `&ss`, and it is reassigned to point to `b` when `foo(b)` is called. This creates a potential aliasing situation between `b` and `&ss` due to the reassignment of `k`.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Function pointer.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 10/10/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

void func1(int *p, int *q) {
	// if function pointer solved correctly,
	// p and q will alias due to CS1
------- LABEL 1
	*p = *q;
}

void (*fp)(int*,int*);

int main() {
	int x, y;
	int *m, *n;
	if (x) {
		m = &x, n = &x;
		fp = func1;
		fp(m,n); // CS1
	}
	else {
		m = &x; n = &y;
//		func1(m,n); // CS2
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the function `func1`, pointers `p` and `q` are parameters that can be passed the same address or different addresses depending on the execution path in `main`. If the `if` condition is true, both `m` and `n` point to `&x`, and `func1` is called with `m` and `n`, making `p` and `q` point to the same location. If the `else` condition is executed, `m` points to `&x` and `n` points to `&y`, and `func1` is not called, so `p` and `q` do not alias. Therefore, `p` and `q` may alias depending on the execution path.

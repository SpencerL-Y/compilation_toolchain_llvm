Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression p alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* foo(int* x){
   return x;
}

int main(){

  int *x,*y,*p,*q,a,b;
  p = &a;
  q = &b;
  x = foo(p);
  y = foo(q);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,p
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: The function `foo` returns the pointer it receives, so after `x = foo(p);`, `x` and `p` must alias as they point to the same memory location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* foo(int* x){
   return x;
}

int main(){

  int *x,*y,*p,*q,a,b;
  p = &a;
  q = &b;
  x = foo(p);
  y = foo(q);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,q
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers y and q are initialized to point to different memory locations, as y is assigned the result of foo(q) which returns q, and q is directly assigned the address of b, while y is assigned the result of foo(q) which returns q. Since y is assigned the result of foo(q) and q is directly assigned the address of b, they point to different memory locations.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* foo(int* x){
   return x;
}

int main(){

  int *x,*y,*p,*q,a,b;
  p = &a;
  q = &b;
  x = foo(p);
  y = foo(q);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,q
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointers x and q are initialized to point to different memory locations, &a and &b respectively, and there are no assignments or operations that could cause them to alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression p alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* foo(int* x){
   return x;
}

int main(){

  int *x,*y,*p,*q,a,b;
  p = &a;
  q = &b;
  x = foo(p);
  y = foo(q);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,p
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `y` is assigned the result of `foo(q)`, which returns `q`, while `p` is directly assigned the address of `a`. Since `p` and `q` are initialized with addresses of different variables (`a` and `b` respectively), `y` and `p` never point to the same location.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = &a;
	q = &b;

    if(a){
	    p = &b;
	    q = &a;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment within the if statement, p may point to either &a or &b, leading to a potential alias with &a.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;

    m = &m1;
	p = &a;
	q = &b;

    if(a){
	    p = &b;
	    q = &a;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment, p may point to the address of b, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression &a1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,&a1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional swap of `p` and `q`, `n` may point to `&a1` if the condition is true, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression &b1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;

	    p = &b;
	    q = &a;
    }

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,&b1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional swap of `p` and `q`, `n` may point to `&b1` if the condition is true, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = &a;
	q = &b;

    if(a){
	    p = &b;

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional swap of `p` and `q`, they may point to the same location depending on the execution path taken.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression &m1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 6":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = &a;
	q = &b;

    if(a){
	    p = &b;
	    q = &a;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,&m1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional swapping of `p` and `q`, `n` may be assigned the address of `m1` through `*q`.

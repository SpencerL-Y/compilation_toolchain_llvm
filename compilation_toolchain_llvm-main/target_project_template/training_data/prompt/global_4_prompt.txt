Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression w alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int g;
int* obj = &g; 
void Zulu(int**p, int *q);

void Xray(){

	int **x,*b,*w,d;
	x = &b; 
	w = &d; 
	Zulu(x,w);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
}


void Zulu(int**p,int *q){
	*p = q;
	*p = obj;
}

int main(){
	Xray();
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,w
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `Zulu` assigns `*p` to `q` and then to `obj`, which means `b` (pointed by `*p`) could potentially point to the same location as `w` (pointed by `q`) or `obj`, leading to a possible aliasing scenario.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &g alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int g;
int* obj = &g; 
void Zulu(int**p, int *q);

void Xray(){

	int **x,*b,*w,d;
	x = &b; 
	w = &d; 
	Zulu(x,w);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
}


void Zulu(int**p,int *q){
	*p = q;
	*p = obj;
}

int main(){
	Xray();
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&g
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `b` is assigned the value of `*p` in function `Zulu`, and `*p` is set to point to `obj`, which is initialized to the address of `g`. Therefore, `b` may point to the same location as `&g` after the execution of `Zulu`.

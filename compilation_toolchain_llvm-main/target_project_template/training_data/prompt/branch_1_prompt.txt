#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int *p, *q;
	int x, y;
	if (x)
		p = &x;
	else
		p = &y;
	q = &y;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, p may point to either &x or &y, while q always points to &y, leading to a potential alias when p points to &y.

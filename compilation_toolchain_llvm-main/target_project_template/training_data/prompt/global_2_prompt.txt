Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *pp and pointer expression *qq alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global pointer in flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int **pp, **qq;
int *p, *q;
int x, y;

void foo() {
	pp = &p;
	p = &x;
	qq = &q;
	q = &y;
------- LABEL 1
}

void bar() {
	qq = &q;
	q = &x;
}

int main() {
	foo();
	bar();
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After executing `foo()`, *pp points to `x` and *qq points to `y`. However, after executing `bar()`, *qq is updated to point to `x`, creating a potential alias with *pp. Thus, *pp and *qq may alias depending on the execution path.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After executing `foo()`, *pp points to `x` and *qq points to `y`. However, after executing `bar()`, *qq is updated to point to `x`, creating a potential alias with *pp.

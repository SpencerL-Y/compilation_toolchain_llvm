Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression g1.sub.d and pointer expression &k2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

typedef struct subagg1{
    int *d;
}subagg1;

typedef struct agg1{
    int *c;
    subagg1 sub;
}agg1;

int main(){
    int *a,*b,k1,k2;
    agg1 g1,g2;
    agg1 *g = &g1;

    if(k1){
        g = &g2;
        a = &k1;
    }
    else{
        a = &k2;
    }

    g->sub.d = a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: g1.sub.d,&k2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, g1.sub.d may be assigned the address of either k1 or k2, leading to potential aliasing with &k2.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: g1.sub.d,&k1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, g1.sub.d may be assigned the address of k1, leading to a potential aliasing situation.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: g2.sub.d,&k2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, g2.sub.d may be assigned the address of either k1 or k2, making it possible for g2.sub.d to point to the same location as &k2.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *pp and pointer expression *qq alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global variable
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 13/10/2013
 * Description: Initialise global variables in callee and check alias
 *		in caller.
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int **pp, **qq;
int *p, *q;
int x;

void foo() {
	pp = &p;
	p = &x;
}

void bar() {
	qq = &q;
	q = &x;
}

int main() {
------- LABEL 1
	foo();
	bar();
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both *pp and *qq are assigned to point to the same memory location &x through indirect assignments, which could potentially lead them to alias.

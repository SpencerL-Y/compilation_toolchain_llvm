[ROLE]
Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

  int **a, *b, *x ,c;
  c = 10;
  a = &b;
  b = &c;
  x = *a;
  int y = *x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
  return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&c
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Pointer x is assigned the value of *a, which is &c through the sequence of assignments, ensuring x always points to the same location as &c.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

  int **a, *b, *x ,c;
  c = 10;
  a = &b;
  b = &c;
  x = *a;
  int y = *x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
  return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,b
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Pointer x is assigned the value of *a, which is b, making x and b point to the same memory location.

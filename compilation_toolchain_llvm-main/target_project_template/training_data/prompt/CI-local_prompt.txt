Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to context-insensitive
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int *m, int *n)
{
------- LABEL 1
}

int main()
{
	int *p, *q;
	int a,b;
	if (a) {
		p = &a;
		q = &b;
		foo(p,q);
	}
	else {
		p = &b;
		q = &a;
		foo(p,q);
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, m and n may point to the same address, as they are assigned the addresses of either `a` or `b` in different orders.

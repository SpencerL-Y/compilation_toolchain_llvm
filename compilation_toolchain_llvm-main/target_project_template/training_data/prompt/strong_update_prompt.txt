Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &p1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void bar(int***k, int***s){

	*k = *s; 

}

int main(){
	int *p1,*q1,*r1,*a1,*b1,*c1,q2,a2;
	int **p = &p1;
	int **q = &q1;
	q1 = &q2;
	bar(&p,&q);
------- LABEL 1
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&p1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `p` is initialized to point to the address of `p1`, but since `p1` is uninitialized, the exact memory location is uncertain, leading to a potential aliasing scenario.

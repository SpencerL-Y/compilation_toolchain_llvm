[ROLE]
Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression w alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int g;
int* obj = &g;
void Zulu(int**p, int *q);
 
void Xray(){

	int **x,*b,*w,d;
	x = &b;
	w = &d;
	Zulu(x,w);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
}


void Zulu(int**p,int *q){

	*p = q;
    *p = obj;
}

void main(){

	Xray();

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,w
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `Zulu` assigns `*p = q` and then `*p = obj`, which means `b` could potentially point to `w` or `obj`, leading to a possible aliasing between `b` and `w`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &g alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int g;
int* obj = &g;
void Zulu(int**p, int *q);
 
void Xray(){

	int **x,*b,*w,d;
	x = &b;
	w = &d;
	Zulu(x,w);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
}


void Zulu(int**p,int *q){

	*p = q;
    *p = obj;
}

void main(){

	Xray();

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&g
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `b` is assigned the value of `w` through `*p = q` in `Zulu`, and then reassigned to `obj` which points to `&g`, creating a potential alias.

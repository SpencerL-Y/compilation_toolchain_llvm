[ROLE]
Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int **p,**q;
int *x,*y,*z;
int a,b,c;
int main() {
	x=&a;
	y=&b;
	x=&b;
	x=&a;
	z=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both x and y are assigned the address of variable 'b' at different points in the program, so they could potentially point to the same address.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int **p,**q;
int *x,*y,*z;
int a,b,c;
int main() {
	x=&a;
	y=&b;
	x=&b;
	x=&a;
	z=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both x and z are assigned the address of variable 'b', so they could potentially point to the same memory location.

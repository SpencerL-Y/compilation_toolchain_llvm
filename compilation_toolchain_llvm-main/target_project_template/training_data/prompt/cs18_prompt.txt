Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj,b;
void bar(int **s){
    *s = &b;
}

void foo(int **p){
	*p = &obj;
	bar(p);
}
main(){
	int **x;
	int *a, *c;
	x=&a; 
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &c;
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `*p` to point to `&obj`, but then `bar` is called with the same pointer `p`, which reassigns `*p` to point to `&b`. Therefore, `a` may point to `&b` after `foo(x)` is called.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &obj alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj,b;
void bar(int **s){
    *s = &b;
}

void foo(int **p){
	*p = &obj;
	bar(p);
}
main(){
	int **x;
	int *a, *c;
	x=&a; 
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &c;
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&obj
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `a` is assigned the address of `obj` through the function `foo`, but it is later reassigned to the address of `b` through the function `bar`, making it possible but not certain that `a` points to `obj`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj,b;
void bar(int **s){
    *s = &b;
}

void foo(int **p){
	*p = &obj;
	bar(p);
}
main(){
	int **x;
	int *a, *c;
	x=&a; 
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &c;
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned through `foo`, which calls `bar` that assigns the address of `b` to the location pointed by `c`, creating a potential alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &obj alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj,b;
void bar(int **s){
    *s = &b;
}

void foo(int **p){
	*p = &obj;
	bar(p);
}
main(){
	int **x;
	int *a, *c;
	x=&a; 
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &c;
	foo(x);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&obj
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the address of `b` through the function `foo`, which calls `bar` to set the pointer to `b`. Since `&obj` is a different memory location, `c` and `&obj` never point to the same address.

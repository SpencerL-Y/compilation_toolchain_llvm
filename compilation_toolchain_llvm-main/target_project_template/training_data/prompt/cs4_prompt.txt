Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the function `foo`, `*y` is assigned the value of `w`, which is `&d` in the first call. Since `b` is assigned the value of `*y`, it may point to `&d` depending on the execution path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &a1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&a1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the value of `t`, which is assigned the value of `*x`. In the first call to `foo`, `*x` is `a`, which is initialized to point to `&a1`, so `c` may point to `&a1`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &r alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&r
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the second call to `foo`, `*y` is assigned `w`, and `*z` is assigned `*x`. Since `p` is passed as both `x` and `y`, and `q` is passed as `z`, `p` and `&r` may alias if `w` is `&r`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the second call to `foo`, both `p` and `q` are passed as arguments, and due to the assignments within `foo`, they may end up pointing to the same location depending on the runtime values of the pointers.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression p alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,p
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both b and p are assigned values through the function `foo`, and since `foo` is called with `ADDRESS_OF[&p]` for both `x` and `y` in the second call, b and p may point to the same location due to potential aliasing through indirect assignments.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression p alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 6":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x,int**y,int **z, int *w){
	int *t;
	*y = w;
	t = *x;
	*z = t;

}

int main(){

	int *a,*b,*c,d,*p,*q,r,a1;
    a = &a1;
	foo(&a,&b,&c,&d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(&p,&p,&q,&r);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,p
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both c and p are assigned values through the function foo, which can potentially make them point to the same memory location depending on the runtime values of the pointers passed to foo.

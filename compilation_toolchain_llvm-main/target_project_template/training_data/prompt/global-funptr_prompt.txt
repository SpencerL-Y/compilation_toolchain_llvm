Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression q and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global variables with function pointer initialisation.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 07/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int x, y;
int* p;

void foo() {
	p = &y;
}

struct MyStruct {
	void (*fp)();
	int* f1;
};

struct MyStruct context = { foo, &x };

int main()
{
	(*context.fp)();
	int* q = p;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: q,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `p`, and then `q` is assigned the value of `p`, so `q` may point to `y` depending on the execution of `foo`.

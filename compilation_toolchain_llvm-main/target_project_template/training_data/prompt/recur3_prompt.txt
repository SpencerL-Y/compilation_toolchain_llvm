Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int x, *y, z;
void f(int **m);
void main(){

	int **a = &y;

	f(a);


}

void f(int **m){
	if(x){
		*m = &x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
		f(m);
	}
	else{
		*m = &z;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	}

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&x
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, y may be assigned the address of x through the pointer m in function f, leading to a potential aliasing situation.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int x, *y, z;
void f(int **m);
void main(){

	int **a = &y;

	f(a);


}

void f(int **m){
	if(x){
		*m = &x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
		f(m);
	}
	else{
		*m = &z;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	}

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the address of either x or z depending on the execution path in function f, making it possible for y to point to the same location as &z.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int x, *y, z;
void f(int **m);
void main(){

	int **a = &y;

	f(a);


}

void f(int **m){
	if(x){
		*m = &x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
		f(m);
	}
	else{
		*m = &z;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	}

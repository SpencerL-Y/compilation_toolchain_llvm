Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m.f1 and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Return a struct instance from function.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 07/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int* f1;
	char f2;
};

int x, y;

struct MyStruct foo() {
	struct MyStruct m;
	m.f1 = &x;
	return m;
}

int main() {
	struct MyStruct m;
	m = foo();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m.f1,&x
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: The pointer m.f1 is directly assigned the address of x in the function foo(), ensuring they always point to the same memory location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m.f1 and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
/*
 * Return a struct instance from function.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 07/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int* f1;
	char f2;
};

int x, y;

struct MyStruct foo() {
	struct MyStruct m;
	m.f1 = &x;
	return m;
}

int main() {
	struct MyStruct m;
	m = foo();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m.f1,&y
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer m.f1 is assigned the address of x in the function foo, and there are no assignments or operations that could change m.f1 to point to the address of y. Different variables x and y have distinct memory addresses, so m.f1 and &y never point to the same location.

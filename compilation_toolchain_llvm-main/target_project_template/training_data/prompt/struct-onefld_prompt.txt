Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression &pint1->f1 and pointer expression &pint2->f1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Struct with one field.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 28/04/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct IntStruct {
	int f1;
};

struct CharStruct {
	char f1;
};

int main() {
	struct IntStruct* pint1, *pint2;
	struct IntStruct s;
	pint1 = &s;
	pint2 = &s;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	
	struct CharStruct* qint1, *qint2;
	struct CharStruct t;
	qint1 = &t;
	qint2 = &t;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &pint1->f1,&pint2->f1
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pint1 and pint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 's', so they always point to the same memory location for the field 'f1'.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &pint1->f1,&s.f1
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pint1 and pint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 's', making &pint1->f1 and &s.f1 guaranteed to point to the same memory location.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &qint1->f1,&qint2->f1
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both qint1 and qint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 't', so their field accesses &qint1->f1 and &qint2->f1 must alias.

Analyze whether pointer expression &qint1->f1 and pointer expression &t.f1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
/*
 * Struct with one field.

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct IntStruct {

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &qint1->f1,&t.f1
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both qint1 and qint2 are directly assigned the address of struct t, making &qint1->f1 and &t.f1 point to the same memory location.

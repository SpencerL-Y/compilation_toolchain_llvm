Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"


int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int **x,**y;
    int *a,*b,*x1,a1,b1;
    int *m,*n,n1;
    /// Note that n needs to be initialized
    n = &n1;
    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    x = y = &x1;
    p = q = &a;
    if(a){
        p = x;
        q = y;
    }

    *p = n;
    m = *q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment, p may point to either the same location as &a or a different location, depending on the runtime value of a.

Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &x1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"


int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int **x,**y;
    int *a,*b,*x1,a1,b1;
    int *m,*n,n1;
    /// Note that n needs to be initialized
    n = &n1;
    a = &a1;

    x = y = &x1;
    p = q = &a;

        p = x;

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&x1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment `p = x` and `x = ADDRESS_OF[&x1]`, `p` may point to the same location as `&x1` depending on the execution path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression &a1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"


int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int **x,**y;
    int *a,*b,*x1,a1,b1;
    int *m,*n,n1;
    /// Note that n needs to be initialized
    n = &n1;
    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    x = y = &x1;
    p = q = &a;
    if(a){
        p = x;
        q = y;
    }

    *p = n;
    m = *q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,&a1
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer `m` is assigned the value of `*q`, which is set to `n` (address of `n1`), while `&a1` is the address of `a1`, and there is no assignment or path that makes `m` point to `&a1`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression &x1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"


int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int **x,**y;
    int *a,*b,*x1,a1,b1;
    int *m,*n,n1;
    /// Note that n needs to be initialized
    n = &n1;
    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    x = y = &x1;
    p = q = &a;
    if(a){
        p = x;
        q = y;
    }

    *p = n;
    m = *q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,&x1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointers p and q are conditionally assigned to x and y, which both point to &x1. Since m is assigned the value of *q, and q may point to x (which points to &x1), m may point to &x1 depending on the execution path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression m alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"


int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int **x,**y;
    int *a,*b,*x1,a1,b1;
    int *m,*n,n1;
    /// Note that n needs to be initialized
    n = &n1;
    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    x = y = &x1;
    p = q = &a;
    if(a){
        p = x;
        q = y;
    }

    *p = n;
    m = *q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,m
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q` to `x` and `y`, `*p` and `*q` may point to the same location, leading to `m` potentially pointing to the same location as `n`.

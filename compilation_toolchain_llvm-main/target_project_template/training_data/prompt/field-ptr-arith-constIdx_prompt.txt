Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *p and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s {
	int* f1;
	int* f2;
};

int main()
{
	int **q, **p;
	int a,b;
	struct s s1;
	s1.f1 = &a;
	s1.f2 = &b;
	q = &(s1.f1);
	p = q+1;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *p,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Pointer *p is derived from q, which points to s1.f1, and p is incremented by 1, potentially pointing to s1.f2, which is assigned the address of &b.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &obj1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj1,obj2;
void foo(int **p, int **q){

	*p = &obj1;
	*q = &obj2;

}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,*x,*y,*z;
	if(a){
		a = &x;
		b = &y;
	}
	else{
		a = &z;
		b = &z;
	}
	foo(a,b);

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&obj1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `x` may be assigned the address of `obj1` through the function `foo`, which assigns `&obj1` to the dereferenced pointer `*p`, and `a` could point to `x` if the `if` condition is true. Thus, `x` may alias with `&obj1`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression z and pointer expression &obj1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj1,obj2;
void foo(int **p, int **q){

	*p = &obj1;
	*q = &obj2;

}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,*x,*y,*z;
	if(a){
		a = &x;
		b = &y;
	}
	else{
		a = &z;
		b = &z;
	}
	foo(a,b);

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: z,&obj1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `z` may be assigned to `*a`, which in turn may be assigned the address of `obj1` through the function `foo`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &obj2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj1,obj2;
void foo(int **p, int **q){

	*p = &obj1;
	*q = &obj2;

}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,*x,*y,*z;
	if(a){
		a = &x;
		b = &y;
	}
	else{
		a = &z;
		b = &z;
	}
	foo(a,b);

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&obj2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `y` may be assigned the address of `z`, which is then assigned the address of `obj2` through the function `foo`, leading to a potential aliasing with `&obj2`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression z and pointer expression &obj2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj1,obj2;
void foo(int **p, int **q){

	*p = &obj1;
	*q = &obj2;

}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,*x,*y,*z;
	if(a){
		a = &x;
		b = &y;
	}
	else{
		a = &z;
		b = &z;
	}
	foo(a,b);

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: z,&obj2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `z` may be assigned the address of `&obj2` through indirect assignments in the `foo` function, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &obj2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj1,obj2;
void foo(int **p, int **q){

	*p = &obj1;
	*q = &obj2;

}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,*x,*y,*z;
	if(a){
		a = &x;
		b = &y;
	}
	else{
		a = &z;
		b = &z;
	}
	foo(a,b);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&obj2
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer x is assigned the address of obj1 through the function foo, while &obj2 is a distinct memory location, ensuring they never point to the same address.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to lack of context-sensitivity.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int *m, int *n)
{
------- LABEL 1
	int x, y;
	x = *n;
	y = *m;
	*m = x;
	*n = y;
}

int main()
{
	int *p, *q;
	int a, b, c;
	if (c) {
		p = &a;
		q = &b;
		foo(p,q);
	}
	else {
		p = &b;
		q = &c;
		foo(p,q);
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, m and n may point to the same memory location if both are assigned the address of `b`.

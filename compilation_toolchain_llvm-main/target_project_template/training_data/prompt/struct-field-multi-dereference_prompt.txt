Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression q->f2->f1 and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to struct.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 10/10/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int * f1;
	struct MyStruct *f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct *p, *q;
	struct MyStruct ms1, ms2;
	int x;
	p = &ms1;
	q = &ms1;
	ms1.f2 = &ms2;
	p->f2->f1 = &x;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: q->f2->f1,&x
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: q and p are assigned to the same address (&ms1), and p->f2 is assigned &ms2, making q->f2 point to ms2. Since p->f2->f1 is assigned &x, q->f2->f1 may also point to &x.

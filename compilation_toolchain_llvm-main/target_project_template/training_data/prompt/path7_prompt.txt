Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;
    q = &e;

    if(d){
        p = &b;
    }
    else{
        q = &d;
    }

    *p = q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q`, `b` and `&e` may alias if the condition `d` is true, leading `p` to point to `b` and subsequently assigning `q` (which points to `&e`) to `*p`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;
    q = &e;

    if(d){
        p = &b;
    }
    else{
        q = &d;
    }

    *p = q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned to either `&b` or `&c`, and `q` could be assigned to either `&e` or `&d`. Therefore, `c` and `&d` may alias if `*p` is assigned to `&c` and `q` is assigned to `&d`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;
    q = &e;

    if(d){
        p = &b;
    }
    else{
        q = &d;
    }

    *p = q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to conditional assignments and indirect pointer manipulation, c and &e may point to the same location depending on the execution path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;
    q = &e;

    if(d){
        p = &b;
    }
    else{
        q = &d;
    }

    *p = q;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment, there exists a path where `p` could point to `b` and `q` could point to `&d`, leading to a potential aliasing when `*p = q` is executed.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;
int *k =&s;
void foo(int**, int**);
main(){
	int **x, **y;
	int *a, *b, *c, *d,*e;
    a = &t;
	x=&a; y =&b; 
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	*b = 5;
	c=&t;
	c=&s;
	a=c;
------- LABEL 3
	if(t) {c=&obj; x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &d;}
	e = &t;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
------- LABEL 7
------- LABEL 8
	*e = 10;
	
}

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the indirect assignment in `foo`, `a` and `b` may point to the same location depending on the execution path and assignments.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &obj alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;
int *k =&s;
void foo(int**, int**);
main(){
	int **x, **y;
	int *a, *b, *c, *d,*e;
    a = &t;
	x=&a; y =&b; 
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	*b = 5;
	c=&t;
	c=&s;
	a=c;
------- LABEL 3
	if(t) {c=&obj; x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &d;}
	e = &t;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
------- LABEL 7
------- LABEL 8
	*e = 10;
	
}

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&obj
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `*p = *q` and then `*q = &obj`. Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the value of `*p`, which could have been set to `&obj` through `*q`. Thus, `b` may alias with `&obj`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;
int *k =&s;

main(){
	int **x, **y;
	int *a, *b, *c, *d,*e;

	x=&a; y =&b; 
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	*b = 5;
	c=&t;
	c=&s;
	a=c;
------- LABEL 3
	if(t) {c=&obj; x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &d;}

------- LABEL 7
------- LABEL 8
	*e = 10;
	
}

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment and potential reassignment of `c` to `a`, `a` and `c` may point to the same memory location depending on the execution path.

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, c and d may both be assigned the address of the same variable, t, making them potentially alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression d and pointer expression &obj alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;
int *k =&s;

------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5

------- LABEL 7
------- LABEL 8
	*e = 10;
	
}

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: d,&obj
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `d` is assigned the address of `t` or `s` through `foo`, and `&obj` is directly assigned to `*q` in `foo`. Since `d` could potentially be assigned the address of `obj` through indirect assignments in `foo`, they may alias.

	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment and potential reassignment of `c` to `a`, `a` and `c` may point to the same memory location depending on the execution path taken.

Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 7":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;

}

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional execution paths and assignments in the program, `a` and `d` may point to the same memory location if the `else` branch is taken, where both `x` and `y` are assigned the address of `d`, and `foo` is called, potentially making `a` and `d` alias through the indirect assignment in `foo`.

Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 8":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int obj, t,s;

void foo(int **p, int **q){
	*p = *q;
	*q = &obj;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, both `c` and `d` can be assigned the address of `t`, leading to potential aliasing.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = q = &a;

    if(a){
	    p = q = &b;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Initially, p is assigned the address of a, but due to the conditional assignment inside the if statement, p may be reassigned to the address of b. Therefore, p may or may not point to the same location as &a, depending on the execution path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = q = &a;

    if(a){
	    p = q = &b;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment `p = q = &b` within the `if(a)` block, `p` may point to `&b` depending on the runtime value of `a`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression &a1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = q = &a;

    if(a){
	    p = q = &b;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,&a1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment, `p` and `q` may point to either `&a1` or `&b1`, leading `n` to potentially point to `&a1` after dereferencing `*q`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression &b1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = q = &a;

    if(a){
	    p = q = &b;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,&b1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q` to `&b`, `n` may point to `&b1` if the condition `if(a)` is true, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression n and pointer expression m alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,**q;
    int *a,*b;
    int *m,*n;
    int a1,b1,m1;

    a = &a1;
    b = &b1;
    m = &m1;
	p = q = &a;

    if(a){
	    p = q = &b;
    }

    *p = m;
	n = *q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: n,m
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment of `p` and `q` to either `&a` or `&b`, `n` and `m` may point to the same location depending on the execution path taken.

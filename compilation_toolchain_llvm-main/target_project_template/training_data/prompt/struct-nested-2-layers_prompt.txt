Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression ptmp and pointer expression pmid alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Struct with nested structs.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 28/04/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct InnerStruct {
	int in1;
	char in2;
};

struct MidStruct {
	int mid1;
	struct InnerStruct mid2;
	char mid3;
};

struct OuterStruct {
	struct MidStruct out1;
	char out2;
	struct InnerStruct out3;
	int out4;
};

int main() {
	struct OuterStruct* pout;
	struct MidStruct* pmid;
	struct MidStruct* ptmp;
	struct InnerStruct* itmp;
	struct InnerStruct* pin;
	struct OuterStruct s;

	pout = &s;
	pmid = &s.out1;
	ptmp = &pout->out1;
------- LABEL 1
	MUSTALIAS(&(ptmp->mid2.in1), &(pmid->mid2.in1));
	MUSTALIAS(&(ptmp->mid2.in2), &(pmid->mid2.in2));

	pin = &s.out1.mid2;
	itmp = &pout->out1.mid2;
------- LABEL 2
	MUSTALIAS(&(itmp->in1), &(pin->in1));
	MUSTALIAS(&(itmp->in2), &(pin->in2));

------- LABEL 3
	
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: ptmp,pmid
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pointers ptmp and pmid are assigned the address of the same struct field s.out1, ensuring they always point to the same memory location.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: itmp,pin
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pointers itmp and pin are directly assigned the address of the same struct field s.out1.mid2, ensuring they always point to the same memory location.

#include "aliascheck.h"

------- LABEL 3
	
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &pout->out3,pin
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different struct fields, out3 and mid2, never alias due to field sensitivity.

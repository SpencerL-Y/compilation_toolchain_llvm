Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;

c1:    if(e){
           p = &b;
           q = &d;
       }
       else if(b) {
           q = &e;
       }
       else if(c){
          printf("dummy branch\n");
       }
       else{
           goto c1;
       }

       *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Initially, p is assigned the address of c, but due to conditional branches, p may be reassigned to point to b, making it possible for p to point to either b or c depending on the execution path.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `p` may be assigned the address of `b`, leading to a potential aliasing relationship.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned the address of `e` through `q`, making `c` and `&e` potentially alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;

       else if(c){
          printf("dummy branch\n");
       }
       else{
           goto c1;

       *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `d` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` when `p` points to `b` and `q` points to `d`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;

c1:    if(e){
           p = &b;
           q = &d;
       }
       else if(b) {
           q = &e;
       }
       else if(c){
          printf("dummy branch\n");
       }
       else{
           goto c1;
       }

       *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, the pointer `p` may be assigned to point to `&c` or `&b`, and subsequently, `*p` is assigned the value of `q`, which may point to `&d`. Thus, `c` and `&d` may alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 6":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *b,*c,d,e;

    p = &c;

c1:    if(e){
           p = &b;
           q = &d;
       }
       else if(b) {
           q = &e;
       }
       else if(c){
          printf("dummy branch\n");
       }
       else{
           goto c1;
       }

       *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned the address of either `b` or `e`, leading to a potential aliasing situation between `b` and `&e`.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a1 and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int** g;

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	g = p;
	*g = q;

}

int main(){
	int **a,*b,*a1,b1;
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	foo(a,b);
------- LABEL 1
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a1,b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `*p = q`, which means `*a = b` in `main`, potentially making `a1` and `b` point to the same location.

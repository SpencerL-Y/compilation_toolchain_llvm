Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Branches for testing flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int **p, **q;
	int *x, *y;
	int x0, y0;
	if (x0) {
		p = &x;
		q = &y;
------- LABEL 1
	}
	else {
		p = &y;
		q = &x;
------- LABEL 2
	}
------- LABEL 3
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, p and q may point to the same address, as they are assigned to the addresses of x and y in different orders based on the condition.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path taken (either through LABEL 1 or LABEL 2), pointers p and q may point to the same memory location, as they are assigned the addresses of x and y in different orders.

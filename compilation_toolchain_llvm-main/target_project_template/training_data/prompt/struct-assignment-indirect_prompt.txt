Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p1->a and pointer expression s2.a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to struct assignment
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s{
	int *a;
	int *b;
};

int main()
{
	struct s s1, s2;
	struct s * p1;
	int x, y;
	s1.a = &x;
	s1.b = &y;
	s2 = s1;
	p1 = &s1;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p1->a,s2.a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The struct s2 is assigned the values of s1, making s2.a point to the same location as s1.a, and since p1 is a pointer to s1, p1->a also points to the same location as s1.a, leading to a potential aliasing between p1->a and s2.a.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p1->b and pointer expression s2.b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
/*
 * Alias due to struct assignment
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s{
	int *a;
	int *b;
};

int main()
{
	struct s s1, s2;
	struct s * p1;
	int x, y;
	s1.a = &x;
	s1.b = &y;
	s2 = s1;
	p1 = &s1;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p1->b,s2.b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Since s2 is assigned the value of s1, s2.b and s1.b point to the same location, and p1->b points to s1.b, they may alias.

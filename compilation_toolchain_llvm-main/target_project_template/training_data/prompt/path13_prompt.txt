Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &f alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
	int **i;
}agg;

int main(){
	int *b,*c,*d,f,w;
	struct agg ag1, *a;
	a = &ag1;

	if(a){
        if(f){
		    a->i = &c;
		    b = &f;
        }
	}
	else{
		a->i = &d;
		b = &w;
	}
	*(a->i) = b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&f
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned to `a->i` only if `f` is true, while `&f` is assigned to `b` in the same condition. Since `b` is then assigned to `*(a->i)`, `c` and `&f` never point to the same location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression d and pointer expression &w alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
	int **i;
}agg;

int main(){
	int *b,*c,*d,f,w;
	struct agg ag1, *a;
	a = &ag1;

	if(a){
        if(f){
		    a->i = &c;
		    b = &f;
        }
	}
	else{
		a->i = &d;
		b = &w;
	}
	*(a->i) = b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: d,&w
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers d and &w are assigned to different memory locations in mutually exclusive branches of the conditional statement, ensuring they never point to the same location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &w alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
	int **i;
}agg;

int main(){
	int *b,*c,*d,f,w;
	struct agg ag1, *a;
	a = &ag1;

	if(a){
        if(f){
		    a->i = &c;
		    b = &f;
        }
	}
	else{
		a->i = &d;
		b = &w;
	}
	*(a->i) = b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&w
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `c` and `&w` may be assigned to the same location through indirect assignments via `a->i`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression d and pointer expression &f alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
	int **i;
}agg;

int main(){
	int *b,*c,*d,f,w;
	struct agg ag1, *a;
	a = &ag1;

	if(a){
        if(f){
		    a->i = &c;
		    b = &f;
        }
	}
	else{
		a->i = &d;
		b = &w;
	}
	*(a->i) = b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: d,&f
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `d` is assigned to `a->i` only in the `else` branch, while `&f` is assigned to `a->i` in the `if` branch, ensuring they never point to the same location.

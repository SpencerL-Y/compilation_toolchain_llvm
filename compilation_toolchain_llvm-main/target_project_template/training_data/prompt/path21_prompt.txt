Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression r and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int ***p,**a,**b,*q,*r,*f,v,z,*g,f1; 

    p = &a;
    a = b = &f;
    f = &f1;
    q = &v;

    if(a){
        f = &z;
        *p = &g;
        b = *p;
    }
    else{


    }

    *a = q;
    r = *b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: r,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `r` and `q` may point to the same location if the condition `if(a)` is true, as `*a` is assigned `q` and `r` is assigned `*b`, which could be the same as `*a` due to the assignment `b = *p` and `*p = ADDRESS_OF[&g]`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression r and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int ***p,**a,**b,*q,*r,*f,v,z,*g,f1; 

    p = &a;
    a = b = &f;
    f = &f1;
    q = &v;

    if(a){
        f = &z;
        *p = &g;
        b = *p;
    }
    else{


    }

    *a = q;
    r = *b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: r,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the execution path where `a` is non-null, `f` is assigned the address of `z`, and `b` is updated to point to `g` through `*p`. Since `*a` is assigned to `q` and `r` is assigned `*b`, `r` may point to `z` if `b` is updated to point to `g` which could potentially be `z`. Thus, `r` and `&z` may alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression r and pointer expression &f1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int ***p,**a,**b,*q,*r,*f,v,z,*g,f1; 

    p = &a;
    a = b = &f;
    f = &f1;
    q = &v;

    if(a){
        f = &z;
        *p = &g;
        b = *p;
    }
    else{


    }

    *a = q;
    r = *b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: r,&f1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional assignment of `f` to `&z` within the `if(a)` block, `r` may point to either `&f1` or `&z`, depending on the execution path, leading to potential aliasing with `&f1`.

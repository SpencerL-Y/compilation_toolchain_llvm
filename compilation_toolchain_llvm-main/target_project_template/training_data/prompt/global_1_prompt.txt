Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *pp and pointer expression *qq alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global pointer in flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int x, y; int *p = &x; int *q = &y;
int **pp = &p; int**qq = &q;

void foo() {
------- LABEL 1
}
void bar() {
     qq = &q;
     q = &x;
}
int main() {
    foo();
    bar();
------- LABEL 2
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After `bar()` executes, `q` is assigned the address of `x`, and since `pp` points to `p` which initially points to `x`, *pp and *qq may point to the same location.

Analyze whether pointer expression *pp and pointer expression *qq alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":

#include "aliascheck.h"

int x, y; int *p = &x; int *q = &y;
int **pp = &p; int**qq = &q;

void foo() {
------- LABEL 1
}
void bar() {
     qq = &q;
     q = &x;
}
int main() {
    foo();
    bar();
------- LABEL 2
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After executing `bar()`, `q` is assigned the address of `x`, making `*qq` potentially point to `x`, while `*pp` always points to `x` through `p`, leading to a potential aliasing scenario.

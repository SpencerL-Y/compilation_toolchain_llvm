[ROLE]
Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int**a, int*b){

	*a = b;

}


void main(){

	int *p,q,*x,y;
	foo(&p,&q);
------- LABEL 1
	foo(&x,&y);
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

	*p = 100;

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&q
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `b` to `*a`, making `p` and `&q` point to the same location after the first call.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int**a, int*b){

	*a = b;

}


void main(){

	int *p,q,*x,y;
	foo(&p,&q);
------- LABEL 1
	foo(&x,&y);
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

	*p = 100;

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `x`, making them potentially point to the same location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int**a, int*b){

	*a = b;

}


void main(){

	int *p,q,*x,y;
	foo(&p,&q);
------- LABEL 1
	foo(&x,&y);
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

	*p = 100;

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&q
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `x` and the address of `q` to `p`, and since `x` and `&q` are initialized with different addresses, they never point to the same location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int**a, int*b){

	*a = b;

}


void main(){

	int *p,q,*x,y;
	foo(&p,&q);
------- LABEL 1
	foo(&x,&y);
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

	*p = 100;

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `x`, and since `p` is assigned the address of `q` in the first call to `foo`, and `x` is assigned the address of `y` in the second call, `p` and `&y` may alias if `x` and `p` are used interchangeably or if `p` is reassigned to point to the same location as `x`.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s[0].f1 and pointer expression s[0].f2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Array alias in flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int *f1;
	int *f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct s[2];
	int x, y;
	s[0].f1 = &x;
	s[1].f2 = &y;

	// Arrays are treated as a single element.
	// Different fields have its own points-to set.
	// Same fields have same points-to set, even they belong
	// to different elements.
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3

	s[0].f1 = &y;
------- LABEL 4
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[0].f1,s[0].f2
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different struct fields never alias due to field sensitivity.

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[0].f1,s[1].f2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: s[0].f1 and s[1].f2 are fields in different struct array elements, and due to conservative array handling, they may alias after s[0].f1 is reassigned to point to the same address as s[1].f2.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[0].f1,s[1].f1
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different fields in struct instances never alias, and s[1].f1 is never initialized.

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[0].f1,s[1].f2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Different fields in struct instances may alias due to conservative array handling and potential runtime index overlap.

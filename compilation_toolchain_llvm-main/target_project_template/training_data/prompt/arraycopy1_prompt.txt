Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression void* and pointer expression void* alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
------- LABEL 1
int main() {
	int a, b;
	int* source[2] = {&a, &b};
	int* x = source[1];
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: source[0], source[1]
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers source[0] and source[1] are initialized to point to different memory locations, &a and &b respectively, and since they are different variables, they never alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression &a and pointer expression x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
------- LABEL 1
int main() {
	int a, b;
	int* source[2] = {&a, &b};
	int* x = source[1];
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: &a,x
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer x is assigned to source[1], which points to &b, while &a is a separate memory location.

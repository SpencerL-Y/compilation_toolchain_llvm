Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *pp and pointer expression *qq alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int f1;
	void (*fp)(int**, int**);
};

struct MyStruct global;
int x, y;

void foo(int** pp, int** qq) {
	*pp = &x;
	*qq = &y;
}

void bar(int** pp, int** qq) {
	*pp = &x;
	*qq = &x;
}

void init() {
	global.fp = foo;
}

void init2() {
	global.fp = bar;
}

void run(int** pp, int**qq) {
	(*global.fp)(pp, qq);
}

int main() {
	int *p, *q;
	int **pp, **qq;
	pp = &p;
	qq = &q;
	init();
	run(pp, qq);
	// They are alias due to the wrongly solved
	// target, bar(), at indirect call site in
	// run().
------- LABEL 1
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function pointer `global.fp` can be set to either `foo` or `bar`, leading to different assignments. In `foo`, `*pp` is assigned `&x` and `*qq` is assigned `&y`, resulting in NO aliasing. In `bar`, both `*pp` and `*qq` are assigned `&x`, resulting in MUST aliasing. Since the execution path is uncertain, *pp and *qq MAY alias.

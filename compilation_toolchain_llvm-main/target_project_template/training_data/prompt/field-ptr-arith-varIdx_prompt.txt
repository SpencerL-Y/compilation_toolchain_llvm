Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *p and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Pointer arithmetic

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s {
	int* f1;
	int* f2;
};

int main()
{
	int **q, **p;
	int a,b;
	struct s s1;
	s1.f1 = &a;
	s1.f2 = &b;
	q = &(s1.f1);
	// b is not a constant, p would point to all
	// the fields of q's points-to targets
	p = q+b;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *p,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `p` is derived from `q`, which points to `s1.f1` (address of `a`). The expression `p = q + b` involves pointer arithmetic, making `p`'s target uncertain and potentially overlapping with `&b`.

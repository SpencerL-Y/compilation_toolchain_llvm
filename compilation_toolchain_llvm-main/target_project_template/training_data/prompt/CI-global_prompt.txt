Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p_local and pointer expression p_global alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*

#include "aliascheck.h"

int global;
int *p_global;

void foo() {
	p_global = &global;
}

int main() {
	int *p_local;
	p_local = &global;
	foo();
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p_local,p_global
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both pointers are assigned the address of the same global variable, but the assignment to p_global occurs in a separate function call, which introduces potential execution path variations.

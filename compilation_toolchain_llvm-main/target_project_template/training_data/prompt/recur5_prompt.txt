Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &r alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* x, x1;
void f(int **m){
int **n,*y,*k,z,r;
   n = &y;
   y = &z;
   if(z==1){
	*n=&r;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	k = *n;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	f(n);
   }
}

int main(){
	x=&x1;
	f(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&r
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the address of z, and through the indirect assignment *n = &r, y may be updated to point to the same location as &r, depending on the execution path taken.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* x, x1;
void f(int **m){
int **n,*y,*k,z,r;
   n = &y;
   y = &z;
   if(z==1){
	*n=&r;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	k = *n;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	f(n);
   }
}

int main(){
	x=&x1;
	f(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&z
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer y is assigned the address of z, but y and &z are distinct because y holds the address of z, while &z is the address itself. They never point to the same memory location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression k and pointer expression &r alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* x, x1;
void f(int **m){
int **n,*y,*k,z,r;
   n = &y;
   y = &z;
   if(z==1){
	*n=&r;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	k = *n;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	f(n);
   }
}

int main(){
	x=&x1;
	f(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: k,&r
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `k` is assigned the value of `*n`, which may point to `&r` if the condition `z==1` is true, creating a potential alias between `k` and `&r`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression k and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* x, x1;
void f(int **m){
int **n,*y,*k,z,r;
   n = &y;
   y = &z;
   if(z==1){
	*n=&r;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	k = *n;
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	f(n);
   }
}

int main(){
	x=&x1;
	f(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: k,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `k` is assigned the value of `*n`, which is set to point to `&z` or `&r` depending on the condition `z==1`. Since `z` is a runtime value and can be either true or false, `k` may point to `&z` in some execution paths.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Branches for testing flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int *p, *q;
	int x, y;
	q = &y;
	if (x) {
		p = &x;
------- LABEL 1
	}
	else {
		p = &y;
------- LABEL 2
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, p may point to either the address of x or the address of y, while q always points to the address of y. Thus, p and q may alias when p points to the address of y.

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int *p, *q;
	int x, y;
	q = &y;
	if (x) {
		p = &x;
------- LABEL 1
	}
	else {
		p = &y;
------- LABEL 2
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, p may point to either &x or &y, while q points to &y, leading to a potential alias when p points to &y.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s2.a and pointer expression s1.a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to struct assignment
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s{
	int *a;
	int b;
};

int main()
{
	struct s s1, s2;
	struct s * p1;
	int x, y;
	s1.a = &x;
	s1.b = y;
	s2 = s1;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s2.a,s1.a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The assignment `s2 = s1` copies the entire struct, including the pointer `s1.a`, to `s2.a`, so `s2.a` and `s1.a` may point to the same location.

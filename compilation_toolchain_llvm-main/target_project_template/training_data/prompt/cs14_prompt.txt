Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int*,int*);
main(){
	int*x, *y;
	int a,b, c;
	if(c)x=&a; 
	else x=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(x,y);
	x = &c;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
	
}

void foo(int *p,int*q){
	*p = 100;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, x may be assigned the address of either &a or &b, leading to potential aliasing with &a.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int*,int*);
main(){
	int*x, *y;
	int a,b, c;
	if(c)x=&a; 
	else x=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(x,y);
	x = &c;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
	
}

void foo(int *p,int*q){
	*p = 100;
}

[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int*,int*);
main(){
	int*x, *y;
	int a,b, c;
	if(c)x=&a; 
	else x=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(x,y);
	x = &c;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
	
}

void foo(int *p,int*q){
	*p = 100;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&c
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer x is assigned the address of either &a or &b before the first call to foo, and then it is reassigned to &c after the first call to foo. Therefore, x and &c never point to the same memory location at the same time.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int*,int*);
main(){
	int*x, *y;
	int a,b, c;
	if(c)x=&a; 
	else x=&b;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(x,y);
	x = &c;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
	
}

void foo(int *p,int*q){
	*p = 100;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, x may be assigned the address of &a, leading to a potential aliasing relationship.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int*,int*);
main(){
	int*x, *y;
	int a,b, c;
	if(c)x=&a;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	foo(x,y);
	x = &c;
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
	
}

void foo(int *p,int*q){
	*p = 100;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, x may be assigned the address of either &a or &b, leading to a potential alias with &b.

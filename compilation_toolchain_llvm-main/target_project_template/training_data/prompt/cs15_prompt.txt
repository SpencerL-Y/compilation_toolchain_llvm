Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a1 and pointer expression &d1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int **w,int**x,int **y, int *z){
	int *t;
	*y = z;
	t = *x;
	*w = t;

}

void bar(int **p1,int**p2,int **p3, int *p4){
	foo(p1,p2,p3,p4);
}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,**c,*d,*a1,*b1,*c1,d1;
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	c = &b1;
	d = &d1;
	bar(a,b,c,d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
//	foo(a,b,c,d);
//	foo(b,a,c,d);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a1,&d1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `*y = z` and `*w = t`, where `y` is `c` and `z` is `d` in `bar`. Since `c` and `b` both point to `&b1`, `*c` and `*b` may alias, leading to `a1` potentially pointing to `d1`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b1 and pointer expression a1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int **w,int**x,int **y, int *z){
	int *t;
	*y = z;
	t = *x;
	*w = t;

}

void bar(int **p1,int**p2,int **p3, int *p4){
	foo(p1,p2,p3,p4);
}

int main(){

	int **a,**b,**c,*d,*a1,*b1,*c1,d1;
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	c = &b1;
	d = &d1;
	bar(a,b,c,d);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
//	foo(a,b,c,d);
//	foo(b,a,c,d);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b1,a1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointers b1 and a1 may alias because both are indirectly assigned through the same pointer b in the function foo, which is called with b and c pointing to the same memory location.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a1 and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int** g;

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	g = q;
	*p = g;
}

int main(){
	int **a,*b,*a1,b1;
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	foo(a,b);
------- LABEL 1
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a1,b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns `g = q` and then `*p = g`, which means `*a = b`. Since `a` points to `a1`, `a1` is assigned the value of `b`, creating a potential aliasing relationship between `a1` and `b`.

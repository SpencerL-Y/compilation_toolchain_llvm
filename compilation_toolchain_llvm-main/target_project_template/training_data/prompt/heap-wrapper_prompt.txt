Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression o1 and pointer expression o2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Heap
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 12/10/2013
 * Description: heap objects are identified according to their
 *		allocation sites.
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

// return one malloc object
int * my_alloc() {
	int * p = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
	return p;
}

int main() {
	int * o1 = my_alloc();
	int * o2 = my_alloc();
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: o1,o2
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers o1 and o2 are initialized by separate calls to my_alloc(), which allocates distinct memory locations for each pointer, ensuring they never point to the same address.

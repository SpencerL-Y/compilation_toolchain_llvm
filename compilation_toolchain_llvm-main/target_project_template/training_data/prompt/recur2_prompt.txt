Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int* x,y;
void f(int *m){
------- LABEL 1
	int *n;
	if(y==1){
		n=&y;

		f(n);
	}
}

int main(){
	x=&y;
	f(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer m is assigned the address of y through the pointer n when y equals 1, creating a potential aliasing scenario.

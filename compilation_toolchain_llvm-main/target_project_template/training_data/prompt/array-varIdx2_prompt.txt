Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s[a].f1 and pointer expression s[b].f2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias with array
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int * f1;
	int * f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct s[2];
	int a,b;
	s[0].f1 = &a;
	s[1].f1 = &b;

	// Different fields of different elements in a 
	// certain array are treated as different objects.
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[a].f1,s[b].f2
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different struct fields never alias due to field sensitivity.

	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[a].f1,s[b].f1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Array elements with different indices and same fields may alias due to uncertain runtime indices.

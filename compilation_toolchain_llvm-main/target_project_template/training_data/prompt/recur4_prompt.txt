Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h" 
int **x, *y;
int z;
void f(int **p);
void main(){
	x = &y;
	f(x);
}


void f(int **p){
	int k;
	y = &k;
	if (z){
		*p = &z;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

		f(p);
	}
	/// y will not alias to &z as the value flow
	/// of y after it is updated at "*p=&z" will
	/// flow into f(p) again and then be updated
	/// by the first statement "y=&k".
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `y` is assigned the address of `k`, but if `z` is non-zero, `*p` (which is `y` through `x`) is assigned the address of `z`, creating a potential alias between `y` and `&z` depending on the execution path.

Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &k alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h" 
int **x, *y;
int z;
void f(int **p);
void main(){
	x = &y;
	f(x);
}


void f(int **p){
	int k;
	y = &k;
	if (z){
		*p = &z;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

		f(p);
	}
	/// y will not alias to &z as the value flow
	/// of y after it is updated at "*p=&z" will
	/// flow into f(p) again and then be updated
	/// by the first statement "y=&k".
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4

}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&k
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the address of k, but then it is reassigned to the address of z within the function f, ensuring y and &k never point to the same location simultaneously.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the address of a local variable k, but within the function f, if the condition (z) is true, *p (which is y) is assigned the address of z, creating a potential aliasing situation.

Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &k alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&k
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the address of k, but then y is reassigned to point to a different location (&z) within the function f, ensuring y and &k never point to the same location simultaneously.

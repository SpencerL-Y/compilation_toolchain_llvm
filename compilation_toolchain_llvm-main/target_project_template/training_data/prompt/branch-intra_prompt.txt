Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to lack of path-sensitivity.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main()
{
	int *p, *q;
	int a, b, c;
	if (c) {
		p = &a;
		q = &b;
	}
	else {
		p = &b;
		q = &c;
	}
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, p and q may point to the same memory location (b), or to different locations (a and b, or b and c).

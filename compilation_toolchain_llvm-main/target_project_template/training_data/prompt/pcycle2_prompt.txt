Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){

    int **a,**b,**c;
    int k;
    a=&b;
    *a=&c;
    *b=&a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is indirectly assigned through `*a`, which is set to point to `&c`, and `*b` is set to point to `&a`. Since `a` is assigned the address of `b`, `*b` can potentially point to `&c`, creating a possible aliasing scenario between `c` and `&a`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){

    int **a,**b,**c;
    int k;
    a=&b;
    *a=&c;
    *b=&a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `b` is assigned the address of `c` through the indirect assignment `*a = ADDRESS_OF[&c]`, and since `a` is initialized to point to `b`, `b` may point to `c`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){

    int **a,**b,**c;
    int k;
    a=&b;
    *a=&c;
    *b=&a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&b
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer 'a' is assigned the address of 'b', making 'a' point to 'b', but '&b' is the address of 'b' itself, which is a distinct memory location from 'a'.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression m alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void f(int** a, int *b)
{
 *a = b; 
}

typedef void (*fp)(int**,int*);

void main()
{
        int **x,*y,*z;
        int *m,*n,m1,n1;
        m = &m1;
        n = &n1;
	fp p = &f;
	x = &y;
	(*p)(x,m);       /* these are equivalent */
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &z;
	p(x,n);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,m
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After the function call `(*p)(x,m);` at LABEL 1, `*x` is assigned the value of `m`, making `y` (which `x` initially points to) and `m` potentially alias. However, due to the reassignment of `x` to point to `z` before the second function call, the aliasing is not guaranteed across all execution paths.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void f(int** a, int *b)
{
 *a = b; 
}

typedef void (*fp)(int**,int*);

void main()
{
        int **x,*y,*z;
        int *m,*n,m1,n1;
        m = &m1;
        n = &n1;
	fp p = &f;
	x = &y;
	(*p)(x,m);       /* these are equivalent */
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &z;
	p(x,n);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `f` assigns `*a = b`, which means `*x = m` at LABEL 1, potentially making `y` point to `m`. At LABEL 3, `*x = n` could make `z` point to `n`. Since `x` is reassigned to `z` before LABEL 3, `y` and `n` may alias if the function `f` is called with `x` pointing to `y` and then `z` pointing to `n`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression z and pointer expression n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void f(int** a, int *b)
{
 *a = b; 
}

typedef void (*fp)(int**,int*);

void main()
{
        int **x,*y,*z;
        int *m,*n,m1,n1;
        m = &m1;
        n = &n1;
	fp p = &f;
	x = &y;
	(*p)(x,m);       /* these are equivalent */
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &z;
	p(x,n);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: z,n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `f` assigns the value of `b` to `*a`, and since `x` is reassigned to point to `z` before the second call to `f`, `z` may be assigned the value of `n`, leading to a potential alias between `z` and `n`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression z and pointer expression m alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void f(int** a, int *b)
{
 *a = b; 
}

typedef void (*fp)(int**,int*);

void main()
{
        int **x,*y,*z;
        int *m,*n,m1,n1;
        m = &m1;
        n = &n1;
	fp p = &f;
	x = &y;
	(*p)(x,m);       /* these are equivalent */
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	x = &z;
	p(x,n);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: z,m
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `z` is assigned to `x` after `x` is assigned to `y`, and `m` is assigned to `*x` through the function call `(*p)(x,m)`. Since `x` is reassigned to point to `z` only after the function call that assigns `m` to `*x`, `z` and `m` never point to the same memory location.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Simple program to test flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int *p, *q, *r;
	int x, y, z;
	p = &x;
	q = &y;
	r = &z;
------- LABEL 1
	p = q;
------- LABEL 2
	p = r;
------- LABEL 3
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After the assignment at LABEL 1, p and q MUST alias. However, at LABEL 2, p is reassigned to r, which breaks the aliasing with q. Considering all possible execution paths, p and q MAY alias.

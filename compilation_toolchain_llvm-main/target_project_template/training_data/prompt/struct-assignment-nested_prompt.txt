Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s2.out4 and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Struct assignment.
 * Author: Sen Ye

 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct InnerArrayStruct {
	int* in1[10];
	int* in2[20];
	char in3;
};

struct MidArrayStruct {
	char mid1[10];
	struct InnerArrayStruct mid2[5];
};

struct ArrayStruct {
	char out2;
	struct MidArrayStruct out3;
	int* out4;
};

int main() {
	struct ArrayStruct* p;
	struct ArrayStruct s1, s2;
	int x, y;

	s1.out4 = &x;
	p = &s1;
	p->out3.mid2[3].in1[3] = &y;

	s2 = s1;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
	
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s2.out4,&x
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer s1.out4 is assigned the address of x, and since s2 is a copy of s1, s2.out4 may also point to the same address as s1.out4, which is &x.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s2.out3.mid2[1].in1[1],&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The assignment `s2 = s1` copies the entire structure, including pointers, and since `s1.out3.mid2[3].in1[3]` is assigned to `&y`, and array indices are uncertain at runtime, `s2.out3.mid2[1].in1[1]` may alias with `&y`.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s2.out3.mid2[3].in1[20],&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The assignment `POINTER_OP[p->out3].POINTER_OP[mid2[3].in1][3] = ADDRESS_OF[&y];` suggests that `s1.out3.mid2[3].in1[3]` points to `&y`. Since `s2` is a copy of `s1`, and array indices are uncertain at runtime, `s2.out3.mid2[3].in1[20]` may alias with `&y`.

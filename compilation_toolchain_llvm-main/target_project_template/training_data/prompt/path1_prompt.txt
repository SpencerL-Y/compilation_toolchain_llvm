Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**, int*);
main(){
	int **x, *y;
	int  *c, *d,e,f;
	if(x) { x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &f;}
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	*p = q;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `c` may be assigned the address of `e` through the function `foo`, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression d and pointer expression &f alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**, int*);
main(){
	int **x, *y;
	int  *c, *d,e,f;
	if(x) { x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &f;}
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	*p = q;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: d,&f
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `d` and `&f` may be assigned to the same location through the function `foo`, which assigns `*p = q`, potentially making `d` point to `f`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &f alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**, int*);
main(){
	int **x, *y;
	int  *c, *d,e,f;
	if(x) { x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &f;}
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	*p = q;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&f
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `c` and `&f` may be assigned to the same location through the function `foo`, which assigns `*p = q`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression d and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**, int*);
main(){
	int **x, *y;
	int  *c, *d,e,f;
	if(x) { x =&c; y =&e;}
	else { x= &d; y = &f;}
	foo(x,y);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
	
}

void foo(int **p, int *q){
	*p = q;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: d,&e
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers d and &e are assigned in mutually exclusive branches of the if-else statement, ensuring they never point to the same memory location.

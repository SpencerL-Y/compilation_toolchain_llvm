Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression obj1.pi and pointer expression &k1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
    int*pi;
    int k;
}agg;

int main(){
    int *s,k1,k2;
    struct agg *a,*b, obj1,obj2;
    /// Note that, all pointers should be properly initialized
    /// the path information uninitialized value are not fully maintained on LLVM PHINode after mem2reg
    a = b = 0;
    if(k1){
        a = &obj1;
        s=&k1;
    }
    else{
        b = &obj2;
        s=&k2;
    }

    a->pi = s;
    b->pi = s;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: obj1.pi,&k1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, obj1.pi may be assigned the address of &k1 through the pointer s, which is conditionally assigned to &k1.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression obj1.pi and pointer expression &k2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
    int*pi;
    int k;
}agg;

int main(){
    int *s,k1,k2;
    struct agg *a,*b, obj1,obj2;
    /// Note that, all pointers should be properly initialized
    /// the path information uninitialized value are not fully maintained on LLVM PHINode after mem2reg
    a = b = 0;
    if(k1){
        a = &obj1;
        s=&k1;
    }
    else{
        b = &obj2;
        s=&k2;
    }

    a->pi = s;
    b->pi = s;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: obj1.pi,&k2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, obj1.pi may be assigned the address of either k1 or k2, leading to potential aliasing with &k2.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression obj2.pi and pointer expression &k2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{
    int*pi;

    a = b = 0;
    if(k1){
        a = &obj1;
        s=&k1;
    }
    else{
        b = &obj2;
        s=&k2;
    }

    a->pi = s;
    b->pi = s;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: obj2.pi,&k2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, both obj2.pi and &k2 could be assigned the same address through the pointer s, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression obj2.pi and pointer expression &k1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct agg{

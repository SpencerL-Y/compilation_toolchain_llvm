Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression pdst->f2 and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Struct casting.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 28/04/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct SrcStruct {
	int* f1;
	int* f2;
	char f3;
};

struct DstStruct {
	char f1;
	int* f2;
	int* f3;
};

int main() {
	struct DstStruct* pdst;
	struct SrcStruct* psrc;
	struct SrcStruct s;
	int x, y, z;

	psrc = &s;
	psrc->f1 = &x;
	psrc->f2 = &y;

	pdst = (struct DstStruct*)psrc;

------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

	pdst->f3 = &z;
------- LABEL 3

	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: pdst->f2,&x
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: pdst->f2 and psrc->f1 may alias because pdst is cast from psrc, and psrc->f1 is assigned the address of x.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: pdst->f2,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: pdst->f2 and &y may alias because pdst is cast from psrc, and psrc->f2 is assigned the address of y, making pdst->f2 potentially point to the same location as &y due to the struct field overlap.

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: psrc->f2,&z
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different struct fields never alias, and psrc->f2 is assigned to &y while pdst->f3 is assigned to &z.

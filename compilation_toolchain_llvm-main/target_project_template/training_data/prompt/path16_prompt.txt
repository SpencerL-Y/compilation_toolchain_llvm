Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    p = &a;
    if(p){
        if(c){
            q = &c;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    if(d){
        *p = q;
    }
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4


}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned the address of `c` through `q`, leading to a potential alias between `a` and `&c`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    p = &a;
    if(p){
        if(c){
            q = &c;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    if(d){
        *p = q;
    }
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4


}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` and `&d` may both be assigned to `*p` through indirect assignment, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    p = &a;
    if(p){
        if(c){
            q = &c;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    if(d){
        *p = q;
    }
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4


}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned the address of `d`, making `a` potentially point to the same location as `&d`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    p = &a;
    if(p){
        if(c){
            q = &c;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    if(d){
        *p = q;
    }
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4


}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `q`, which could be `&c` if the first `if` condition is true and `c` is non-zero.

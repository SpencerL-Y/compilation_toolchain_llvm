Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to conditional assignments and the potential for `a` to be assigned the value of `q`, which may point to `&c` depending on the execution path, `a` and `&c` may alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, *p could be assigned the address of either &d or &e, and since a is pointed to by p in one path, a may end up pointing to &d.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, *p could be assigned the address of either b or e, leading to potential aliasing between b and &e.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &e alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&e
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `a` may be assigned the value of `q`, which can be `&e` if the `else` branch is taken. Thus, `a` and `&e` may alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 5":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&c
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `b` is assigned the address of `b` itself, while `&c` is the address of `c`. Since `b` and `c` are different variables, they never point to the same memory location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 6":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d,e;
    q = &c;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        if(c){
            q = &d;
        }
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &e;
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
------- LABEL 5
------- LABEL 6

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned the address of `d` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` when `a` is non-null and `c` is true.

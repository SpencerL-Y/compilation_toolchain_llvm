Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**,int* );
int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
        foo(p,q);
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
        foo(p,q);
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

void foo(int**x,int *y){
    *x = y;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&c
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointer `a` is assigned through `p` to point to `q`, which is either `&c` or `&d` depending on the execution path, but `a` itself is never directly assigned to `&c`. Since `a` and `&c` are never assigned the same address, they do not alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**,int* );
int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
        foo(p,q);
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
        foo(p,q);
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

void foo(int**x,int *y){
    *x = y;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` and `&d` may be assigned to the same location through the function `foo` and subsequent assignment `*p = q`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**,int* );
int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
        foo(p,q);
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
        foo(p,q);
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

void foo(int**x,int *y){
    *x = y;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `a` may be assigned the value of `d` through the function `foo`, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

void foo(int**,int* );
int main(){

    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
        foo(p,q);
    }
    else{
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
        foo(p,q);
    }

    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

void foo(int**x,int *y){
    *x = y;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&c
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers b and &c are assigned to different memory locations in separate branches of the conditional statement, ensuring they never point to the same location.

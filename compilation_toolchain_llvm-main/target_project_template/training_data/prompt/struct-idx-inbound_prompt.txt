Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression void* and pointer expression void* alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
------- LABEL 1

struct S {int f0; int f1; int f2;};

int main()
{
	struct S s;
	void *a, *b, *c, *d;
	
	a = &s;
	b = &((struct S*) a)->f1;
	c = &((struct S*) b)->f1;
	d = &((struct S*) a)->f1;
	
------- LABEL 2

	return 0;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,c
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer `b` points to `s.f1`, while `c` points to `s.f2`, and different struct fields never alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
------- LABEL 1

struct S {int f0; int f1; int f2;};

int main()
{
	struct S s;
	void *a, *b, *c, *d;
	
	a = &s;
	b = &((struct S*) a)->f1;
	c = &((struct S*) b)->f1;
	d = &((struct S*) a)->f1;
	
------- LABEL 2

	return 0;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,d
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pointers c and d are assigned the address of the same field f1 of the struct instance s, hence they always point to the same memory location.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x, y, z;

void f() {
  if(z > 5) return;
  z++;
  if (1) {
         x = &y;
------- LABEL 1
          f();
         x = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
          f();
  }
}


int main()
{
           f();
	   return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the recursive nature of function `f`, there are execution paths where `x` is assigned the address of `y` before the function returns, leading to a potential aliasing situation.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x, y, z;

void f() {
  if(z > 5) return;
  z++;
  if (1) {
         x = &y;
------- LABEL 1
          f();
         x = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
          f();
  }
}


int main()
{
           f();
	   return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the recursive nature of function `f`, `x` may be assigned the address of `z` in one execution path, leading to potential aliasing.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x, y, z;

void f() {
  if(z > 5) return;
  z++;
  if (1) {
         x = &y;
------- LABEL 1
          f();
         x = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
          f();
  }
}


int main()
{
           f();
	   return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the recursive nature of function `f` and the conditional assignments, `x` may point to `&y` before the recursive call, but it is reassigned to `&z` after the call, creating a potential aliasing scenario depending on the execution path.

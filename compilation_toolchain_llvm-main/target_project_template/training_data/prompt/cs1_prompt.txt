Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int **x, int **y){

	x = y;
}

int main(){

	int *a, *b;
	int a1, b1;
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	foo(a,b);
------- LABEL 1
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,b
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: The pointers `a` and `b` are assigned the addresses of different variables `a1` and `b1`, and the function `foo` modifies only the local copies of the pointers, not the original pointers in `main`.

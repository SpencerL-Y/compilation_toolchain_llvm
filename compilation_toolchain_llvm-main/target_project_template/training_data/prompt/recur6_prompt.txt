Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x,y,z;

void f();

int main(){
    f();
    *x=100;
}

void f(){
    
    if(z){
	x=&y;
	f();
	x=&z;
	f();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    }
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer x is assigned the address of &z in one execution path of function f, so x may point to the same location as &z depending on the runtime value of z.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x,y,z;

void f();

int main(){
    f();
    *x=100;
}

void f(){
    
    if(z){
	x=&y;
	f();
	x=&z;
	f();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    }
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer x is assigned the address of &y in one execution path, but it is also reassigned to &z in another path, leading to potential aliasing with &y depending on the execution path taken.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x,y,z;

void f();

int main(){
    f();
    *x=100;
}

void f(){
    
    if(z){
	x=&y;
	f();
	x=&z;
	f();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    }
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional execution and reassignment of x to both &y and &z within function f(), x may point to &z depending on the execution path taken.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *x,y,z;

void f();

int main(){
    f();
    *x=100;
}

void f(){
    
    if(z){
	x=&y;
	f();
	x=&z;
	f();
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    }
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the conditional execution and recursive calls in function `f`, `x` may be assigned the address of `y` in some execution paths, leading to potential aliasing.

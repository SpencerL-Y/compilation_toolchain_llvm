Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *p and pointer expression *q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Simple program to test flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int **p, **q;
	int *x, *y;
	int x0, y0;
	p = &x;
	q = &y;
	*p = &x0;
	*q = &y0;
------- LABEL 1
	*p = *q;
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *p,*q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After the assignment at LABEL 1, *p and *q may alias because *p is assigned the value of *q, which means they could potentially point to the same address depending on the runtime values of x0 and y0.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *p and pointer expression *q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":

#include "aliascheck.h"

int main() {
	int **p, **q;
	int *x, *y;
	int x0, y0;
	p = &x;
	q = &y;
	*p = &x0;
	*q = &y0;
------- LABEL 1
	*p = *q;
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *p,*q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After the assignment at LABEL 1, *p and *q may point to the same location because *p is assigned the value of *q, creating a potential aliasing situation.

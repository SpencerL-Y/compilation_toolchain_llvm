Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression pms2->f4 and pointer expression pms1->f2.f3 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Nested structs
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct2 {
	int * f3;
	int * f4;
};

struct MyStruct1 {
	int *f1;
	struct MyStruct2 f2;
};

int main()
{
	struct MyStruct1 ms;
	struct MyStruct1 *pms1;
	struct MyStruct2 *pms2;
	int a, b, c;
	ms.f1 = &c;
	ms.f2.f3 = &a;
	ms.f2.f4 = &b;
	pms1 = &ms;
	pms2 = &ms.f2;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: pms2->f4,pms1->f2.f3
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different fields within the same struct instance never alias due to field sensitivity.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: pms2->f3,pms1->f2.f3
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both pointers are assigned to the same memory location through the direct assignment `pms2 = &ms.f2`, making `pms2->f3` and `pms1->f2.f3` point to the same address.

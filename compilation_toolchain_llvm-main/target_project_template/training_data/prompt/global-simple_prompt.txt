Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression *qq_int and pointer expression q_int alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global variables test.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 03/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int a_int = 10;
int* p_int = &a_int;
int** pp_int = &p_int;

int main() {
	int b_int = a_int;
	int* q_int = p_int;
	int** qq_int = pp_int;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *qq_int,q_int
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: Both *qq_int and q_int are directly assigned from pp_int and p_int respectively, which are initialized to point to the same memory location as p_int, thus they must alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression q_int and pointer expression &a_int alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
/*
 * Global variables test.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 03/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int a_int = 10;
int* p_int = &a_int;
int** pp_int = &p_int;

int main() {
	int b_int = a_int;
	int* q_int = p_int;
	int** qq_int = pp_int;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: q_int,&a_int
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: q_int is assigned the value of p_int, which points to a_int, so q_int may point to the same location as &a_int.

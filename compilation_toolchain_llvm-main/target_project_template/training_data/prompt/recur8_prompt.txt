Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z1,z2;
void foo(int **p);
void bar(int **a){
	if(z1>5) return;
	z1++;
	int *c, b;
	*a = &b;
	c = *a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
	foo(a);
}


void foo(int** p){

	p = malloc(10);
	*p = &z2;
	bar(p);
}

int main(){

	int **x, *y;
	x = &y;
	y = &z1;
	foo(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&b
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the value of `*a`, which is set to the address of `b` in one execution path, but `foo` may modify `*a` to point elsewhere, leading to uncertainty.

Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &z1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z1,z2;
void foo(int **p);
void bar(int **a){
	if(z1>5) return;
	z1++;
	int *c, b;
	*a = &b;
	c = *a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
	foo(a);
}


void foo(int** p){

	p = malloc(10);
	*p = &z2;
	bar(p);
}

int main(){

	int **x, *y;
	x = &y;
	y = &z1;
	foo(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&z1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the value of `*a`, which is initially set to the address of `b`. However, `foo` is called with `a` as an argument, and within `foo`, `*p` is set to the address of `z2`. Since `bar` is called recursively and `z1` is initially assigned to `y` in `main`, there is a potential execution path where `c` could point to `z1`. Thus, `c` and `&z1` may alias.

Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &z2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z1,z2;
void foo(int **p);
void bar(int **a){
	if(z1>5) return;
	z1++;
	int *c, b;
	*a = &b;
	c = *a;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
	foo(a);
}


void foo(int** p){

	p = malloc(10);
	*p = &z2;
	bar(p);
}

int main(){

	int **x, *y;
	x = &y;
	y = &z1;
	foo(x);
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&z2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the value of `*a`, which is set to point to `&b` in `bar`. However, `foo` assigns `*p` to `&z2`, and since `bar` calls `foo`, `c` may end up pointing to `&z2` through the indirect assignment path.

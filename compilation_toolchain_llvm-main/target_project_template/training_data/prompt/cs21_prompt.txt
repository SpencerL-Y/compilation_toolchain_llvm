Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression y and pointer expression &a alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int a;
int *foo(int *x){
   int*z = x;
   int* y;
   if(x)
    y = foo(z);
   else
    y = x;

------- LABEL 1
    return y;

}

int main(){
 int*p;
 p = &a;

 foo(p);

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: y,&a
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer y is assigned the result of foo(z) or x, where x initially points to &a. Due to the recursive nature of foo and conditional assignments, y may potentially point to &a.

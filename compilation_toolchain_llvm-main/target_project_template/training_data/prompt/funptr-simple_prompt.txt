Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Function pointer.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 10/10/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

void f(int *p, int *q) {
	// if function pointer solved correctly,
	// p and q will alias due to CS1
------- LABEL 1
}

void (*fptr)(int*,int*);

int main() {
	int x, y;
	int *m, *n;
	if (x) {
		m = &x, n = &x;
		fptr = f;
		fptr(m,n); // CS1
	}
	else {
		m = &x; n = &y;
		f(m,n); // CS2
	}
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, pointers p and q may both point to the same memory location (address of x) or different locations (addresses of x and y).

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s[0].f1 and pointer expression s[1].f2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Array alias in flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int *f1;
	int *f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct s[2];
	int x, y;
	s[0].f1 = &x;
	s[1].f2 = &y;

	s[0].f1 = &y;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s[0].f1,s[1].f2
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Although s[0].f1 and s[1].f2 are different fields and would typically not alias, the assignment of s[0].f1 to the address of &y creates a potential alias with s[1].f2, which also points to &y.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Global variables test.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 03/05/2014
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

int *p = NULL;
int *q = NULL;
int c;

void foo() {
------- LABEL 1
}

void bar() {
	q = &c;
}

int main() {
	int a, b;
	p = &a;
	q = p;
	p = &c;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After `q = p;` in `main`, `p` and `q` MUST alias. However, `p` is later reassigned to point to `&c`, while `q` remains unchanged, leading to a potential aliasing situation depending on execution order. Thus, `p` and `q` MAY alias.

Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s1.f1 and pointer expression s1.f2 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Struct alias in flow-sensitive analysis.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 08/11/2013
 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int *f1;
	int *f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct s1, s2;
	int x, y;
	s1.f1 = &x;
	s1.f2 = &y;
	s2.f1 = &y;
	s2.f2 = &x;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2

	s1.f1 = &y;
------- LABEL 3
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s1.f1,s1.f2
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Different fields in the same struct instance never alias.

Analyze whether pointer expression s1.f1 and pointer expression s2.f1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int *f1;

};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct s1, s2;

------- LABEL 2

	s1.f1 = &y;
------- LABEL 3
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s1.f1,s2.f1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Initially, s1.f1 points to &x and s2.f1 points to &y, but after the assignment at LABEL 3, s1.f1 is updated to point to &y, which is the same location as s2.f1, creating a potential aliasing scenario.

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s1.f1,s2.f1
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Initially, s1.f1 points to &x and s2.f1 points to &y, but after the assignment at LABEL 3, s1.f1 is updated to point to &y, which is the same location as s2.f1, creating a potential aliasing scenario.

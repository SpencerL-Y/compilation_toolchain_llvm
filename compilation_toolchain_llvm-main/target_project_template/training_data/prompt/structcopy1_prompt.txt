Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression void* and pointer expression void* alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
------- LABEL 1
struct innerStruct{
int m;
int* n;
};
struct myStruct{
float a;
struct innerStruct b;
};

int main(){
  struct myStruct x;
  x.b.n = malloc(10);
  struct myStruct y;
  memcpy(&y,&x,sizeof(struct myStruct));
------- LABEL 2
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x.b.n, y.b.n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: After the memcpy operation, the pointer y.b.n may point to the same memory location as x.b.n, as memcpy copies the entire contents of x into y, including the pointer value.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x.b.n and pointer expression y.b.n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
------- LABEL 1
struct innerStruct{
int m;
int* n;
};
struct myStruct{
float a;
struct innerStruct b;
};

int main(){
  struct myStruct x;
  x.b.n = malloc(10);
  struct myStruct y;
  memcpy(&y,&x,sizeof(struct myStruct));
------- LABEL 2
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x.b.n,y.b.n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The memcpy operation copies the entire contents of struct x to struct y, including the pointer x.b.n, making y.b.n potentially point to the same memory location as x.b.n.

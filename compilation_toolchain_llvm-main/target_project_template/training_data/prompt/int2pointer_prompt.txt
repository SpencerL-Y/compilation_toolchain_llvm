Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to casting between
 * integer and pointer.

#include "aliascheck.h"

struct MyStruct {
	int f1;
	int f2;
};

int main() {
	struct MyStruct ms;
	int *p, *q;
	p = &(ms.f1);
	// cast pointer to integer
	int addr = (int)p;
	// cast integer to pointer and
	// q would point to blackhole
	q = (int*)addr + 1;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer `p` is assigned the address of `ms.f1`, while `q` is calculated to point to an address offset by one integer size from `p`, thus they never point to the same memory location.

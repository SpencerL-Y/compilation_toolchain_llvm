Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int **p,*x, y, z;

void f() {
  p = &x;
  if (z) {
    *p = &y;
------- LABEL 1
    f();
    *p = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    f();
  }
}


int main()
{
    f();
    return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `p` can be assigned the address of `x`, and subsequently, `*p` can be assigned the address of `y`, making `x` and `&y` potentially point to the same location through indirect assignment.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int **p,*x, y, z;

void f() {
  p = &x;
  if (z) {
    *p = &y;
------- LABEL 1
    f();
    *p = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    f();
  }
}


int main()
{
    f();
    return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Due to the recursive function `f`, `*p` can be assigned the address of either `y` or `z`, and since `p` initially points to `x`, `x` may end up pointing to `z` through indirect assignments.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression &y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int **p,*x, y, z;

void f() {
  p = &x;
  if (z) {
    *p = &y;
------- LABEL 1
    f();
    *p = &z;
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
    f();
  }
}


int main()
{
    f();
    return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,&y
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: In the function `f`, the pointer `*p` is conditionally assigned the address of `y`, and since `p` points to `x`, `x` may point to `y` depending on the execution path.

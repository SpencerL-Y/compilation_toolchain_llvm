Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression m and pointer expression n alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to function pointer resolution.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

void f(int *m, int *n)
{
------- LABEL 1
}

typedef void (*fp)(int*m, int*n);

int main()
{
	int a,b,c,d;
	int *pa, *pb;
    fp p;
	pa = &a, pb = &b;
	f(pa, pb);
    p = f;
	pb = &a;
    (*p)(pa, pb); 
	return 0;
}


[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: m,n
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `f` is called twice with different pointer assignments, and during the second call, both `pa` and `pb` point to the same memory location `&a`, making `m` and `n` potentially alias.

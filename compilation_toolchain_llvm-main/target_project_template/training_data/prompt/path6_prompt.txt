Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
    }
    else if(b) {
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    else{
      printf("dummy branch\n");
    }
    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, pointer `a` may be assigned the address of `c` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` when `p` points to `a` and `q` points to `&c`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
    }
    else if(b) {
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    else{
      printf("dummy branch\n");
    }
    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, if the condition `else if(b)` is true, `p` is assigned the address of `b` and `q` is assigned the address of `d`, making `*p = q` potentially point `b` to `&d`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression &d alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
    }
    else if(b) {
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    else{
      printf("dummy branch\n");
    }
    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,&d
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `*p` could be assigned to `&d` if `b` is true, leading to a potential alias between `a` and `&d`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"

int main(){
    int **p,*q;
    int *a,*b,c,d;
    if(a){
        p = &a;
        q = &c;
    }
    else if(b) {
        p = &b;
        q = &d;
    }
    else{
      printf("dummy branch\n");
    }
    *p = q;
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Depending on the execution path, `b` may be assigned to `p` and `q` may be assigned to `&c`, leading to a potential aliasing relationship between `b` and `&c` through the indirect assignment `*p = q`.

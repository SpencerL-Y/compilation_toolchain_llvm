Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int q){
  int i = 10;
  int k = i;

}
int main(){

int *s,*r,*x,**y,t,z,k;
	s = &t;
	r = &z;
	y = &r;
	s = r;
------- LABEL 1
	x = *y;
------- LABEL 2
	foo(k);
return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s,&z
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: After the assignment `s = r`, and since `r` is initialized to point to `&z`, `s` and `&z` must alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression r alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
void foo(int q){
  int i = 10;
  int k = i;

}
int main(){

int *s,*r,*x,**y,t,z,k;
	s = &t;
	r = &z;
	y = &r;
	s = r;
------- LABEL 1
	x = *y;
------- LABEL 2
	foo(k);
return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,r
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: After the assignment `s = r;`, both `s` and `r` point to the same location, and since `x = *y;` where `y` points to `r`, `x` must point to the same location as `r`.

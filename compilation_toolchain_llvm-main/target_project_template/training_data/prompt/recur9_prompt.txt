Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z;
void foo(int **a);
void bar(int **q){
    int** a = malloc(10);
    foo(a);
}

void foo(int **a){
    if(z>5) return;
    z++;
    *a = &z;
    bar(a);
}




int main(){
    int** a,*b,*c,b1,c1;
    b = &b1;
    a = &b;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    a = &c;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `b` is assigned the address of `b1`, and `a` is assigned the address of `b`. In the function `foo`, `*a` is assigned the address of `z`, which means `b` may point to `z` through the indirect assignment path.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression &b1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z;
void foo(int **a);
void bar(int **q){
    int** a = malloc(10);
    foo(a);
}

void foo(int **a){
    if(z>5) return;
    z++;
    *a = &z;
    bar(a);
}




int main(){
    int** a,*b,*c,b1,c1;
    b = &b1;
    a = &b;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    a = &c;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,&b1
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: After the assignment `b = ADDRESS_OF[&b1];` in the `main` function, pointer `b` is directly assigned the address of `b1`, ensuring that `b` and `&b1` always point to the same memory location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &z alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z;
void foo(int **a);
void bar(int **q){
    int** a = malloc(10);
    foo(a);
}

void foo(int **a){
    if(z>5) return;
    z++;
    *a = &z;
    bar(a);
}




int main(){
    int** a,*b,*c,b1,c1;
    b = &b1;
    a = &b;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    a = &c;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MAY alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&z
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The pointer `c` is assigned the address of `z` through the indirect assignment in the recursive function `foo`, which modifies the location pointed to by `a` to `&z`. Since `a` can be assigned to `c` in the main function, `c` may point to `&z` after the execution of `foo`.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression c and pointer expression &c1 alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 4":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int z;
void foo(int **a);
void bar(int **q){
    int** a = malloc(10);
    foo(a);
}

void foo(int **a){
    if(z>5) return;
    z++;
    *a = &z;
    bar(a);
}




int main(){
    int** a,*b,*c,b1,c1;
    b = &b1;
    a = &b;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
    a = &c;
    foo(a);
------- LABEL 3
------- LABEL 4
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: c,&c1
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointer `c` is never assigned the address of `c1`, and `c1` is a distinct variable from `c`, ensuring they never point to the same location.

[QUESTION]

/*
 * Global pointer in flow-sensitive analysis.

 */

#include "aliascheck.h"

int **pp, **qq;
int *p, *q;
int x;

void foo() {
	*pp = &x;
}

void bar() {
	qq = &q;
	q = &x;
}

int main() {
	pp = &p;
	foo();
	bar();
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: *pp,*qq
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: Both *pp and *qq may point to the same memory location &x through different execution paths.

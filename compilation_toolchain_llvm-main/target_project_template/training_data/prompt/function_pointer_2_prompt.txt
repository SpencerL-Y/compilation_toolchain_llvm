Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression p and pointer expression q alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Function pointer.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 10/10/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"


void func1(int **p, int **q) {
	*p = *q;
------- LABEL 1
}

void (*fp)(int**,int**);

int main() {
	int o1, o2;
	int *x, *y;
	int **m, **n;
	x = &o1;
	y = &o2;
	m = &x;
	n = &x;
	fp = func1;
	fp(m,n);
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: p,q
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: In function `func1`, the assignment `*p = *q` ensures that `*p` and `*q` point to the same memory location, making `p` and `q` must-alias at LABEL 1.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression x and pointer expression y alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
/*
 * Function pointer.
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 10/10/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"


void func1(int **p, int **q) {
	*p = *q;
------- LABEL 1
}

void (*fp)(int**,int**);

int main() {
	int o1, o2;
	int *x, *y;
	int **m, **n;
	x = &o1;
	y = &o2;
	m = &x;
	n = &x;
	fp = func1;
	fp(m,n);
------- LABEL 2
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: x,y
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Pointers x and y are initialized to point to different memory locations, &o1 and &o2 respectively, and there are no assignments or operations in the program that could cause them to alias.

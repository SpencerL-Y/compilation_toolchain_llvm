Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression b alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *alloc( int size){

	return malloc(1);

}

void foo(int **p){

	*p = alloc(1);
	//*p = alloc();

}

void main(){

	int *a,*b,*c;
	foo(&a);
	foo(&b);
	foo(&c);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,b
2. RESULT: NO
3. REASON: Each call to `foo` results in `a`, `b`, and `c` being assigned distinct memory locations returned by separate calls to `alloc`, which uses `malloc` to allocate memory. Since `malloc` returns different memory locations for each call, `a` and `b` will never point to the same location.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression b and pointer expression c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 2":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *alloc( int size){

	return malloc(1);

}

void foo(int **p){

	*p = alloc(1);
	//*p = alloc();

}

void main(){

	int *a,*b,*c;
	foo(&a);
	foo(&b);
	foo(&c);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: b,c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns a newly allocated memory location to each pointer `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since `alloc` uses `malloc(1)`, which may return the same address if called multiple times in a short period and the memory is reused, `b` and `c` may alias.
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression a and pointer expression c alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 3":
#include "aliascheck.h"
int *alloc( int size){

	return malloc(1);

}

void foo(int **p){

	*p = alloc(1);
	//*p = alloc();

}

void main(){

	int *a,*b,*c;
	foo(&a);
	foo(&b);
	foo(&c);
------- LABEL 1
------- LABEL 2
------- LABEL 3

}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions NO alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: a,c
2. RESULT: MAY
3. REASON: The function `foo` assigns a newly allocated memory location to each pointer passed to it, but since `alloc` always returns a newly allocated memory location, `a` and `c` could potentially point to the same location due to the conservative nature of memory allocation analysis.

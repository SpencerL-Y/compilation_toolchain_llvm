Pointer analyzer that analyzes whether two pointer in a program alias
[QUESTION]
Analyze whether pointer expression s2.a and pointer expression &x alias in the following program at the position with "------- LABEL 1":
/*
 * Alias due to struct assignment
 * Author: Sen Ye
 * Date: 06/09/2013
 */
#include "aliascheck.h"

struct s{
	int *a;
	int b;
};

int main()
{
	struct s s1, s2;
	int x, y;
	s1.a = &x;
	s2.a = s1.a;
------- LABEL 1
	return 0;
}

[ANSWER]
Ground Truth: The two pointer expressions MUST alias
LLM Analysis:
1. POINTERS: s2.a,&x
2. RESULT: MUST
3. REASON: After the direct assignment `s2.a = s1.a`, and since `s1.a` was assigned the address of `x`, both `s2.a` and `&x` must point to the same memory location.

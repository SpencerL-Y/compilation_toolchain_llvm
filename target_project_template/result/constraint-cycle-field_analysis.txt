Analysis Results - constraint-cycle-field
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: q->next and p->next->next
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both q->next and p->next->next are dynamically allocated in a loop, and due to the uncertainty of the loop's execution count, they may point to the same or different memory locations.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: q->f1 and p->next->f1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both q->f1 and p->next->f1 are fields in different instances of the same struct type, and due to the loop, they may point to the same memory location as the loop creates multiple struct instances dynamically.

Analysis Results - array_alias_3
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f2
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Although s[0].f1 and s[1].f2 are different fields and thus would not alias by field sensitivity, the assignment of s[0].f1 to &y makes it point to the same location as s[1].f2, which is also assigned to &y. Therefore, they may alias.

Analysis Results - field-ptr-arith-varIdx
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: *p and &b
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `p` is assigned `q + b`, where `q` points to `s1.f1`, which is initialized to the address of `a`. The expression `q + b` involves pointer arithmetic, and since `b` is an integer, it introduces uncertainty in the exact address `p` points to. Therefore, `*p` may potentially point to the same location as `&b`, but it is not guaranteed.

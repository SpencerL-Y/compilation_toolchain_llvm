Analysis Results - struct-assignment-indirect
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p1->a and s2.a
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The struct s2 is assigned the values of s1, making s2.a point to the same location as s1.a, and since p1 is a pointer to s1, p1->a and s2.a may point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: p1->b and s2.b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The struct s2 is assigned from s1, making s2.b point to the same location as s1.b, and since p1 points to s1, p1->b and s2.b may alias due to the assignment.

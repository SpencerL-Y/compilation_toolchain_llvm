==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: *pp and *qq

LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function pointer `global.fp` can be set to either `foo` or `bar`, leading to different aliasing outcomes; `foo` makes `*pp` and `*qq` point to different locations, while `bar` makes them point to the same location.

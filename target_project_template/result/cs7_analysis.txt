Analysis Results - cs7
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: x and y
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the call to `foo(a, b)`, the assignment `*q = *p` within `foo` makes `*b` point to the same location as `*a`, which means `y` points to the same location as `x`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: w and k
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns the value pointed to by `c` to `d`, which means `w` and `k` may point to the same location after the call to `foo(c,d)`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and k
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers x and k are initialized to point to different memory locations (x1 and k1 respectively) and there are no assignments or function calls in the program that could make them point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: y and w
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The function `foo` assigns the value pointed to by the first argument to the location pointed to by the second argument. In the main function, `foo(a, b)` assigns `*a` (which is `x`) to `*b` (which is `y`), and `foo(c, d)` assigns `*c` (which is `w`) to `*d` (which is `k`). Since `y` and `w` are assigned from different sources and there are no further assignments that could make them point to the same location, they never alias.

Analysis Results - struct-nested-2-layers
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: ptmp and pmid
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pointers ptmp and pmid are assigned the address of the same struct field s.out1, making them always point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: itmp and pin
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pointers itmp and pin are directly assigned the address of the same struct field s.out1.mid2, ensuring they always point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: &pout->out3 and pin
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias, and &pout->out3 and pin point to different fields in the struct.

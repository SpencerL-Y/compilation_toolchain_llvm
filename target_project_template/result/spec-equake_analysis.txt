Analysis Results - spec-equake
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: disp and K
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers `disp` and `K` are allocated separately and point to distinct memory locations, ensuring they never alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: disp and v
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers disp and v are allocated separately and point to different memory locations, with no assignments or operations that could cause them to alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: disp[1] and K[Anext]
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: disp[1] and K[Anext] are allocated separately and initialized independently, ensuring they point to distinct memory locations.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: disp[1] and v[i]
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: disp[1] and v[i] are allocated from separate memory allocations and are never assigned to each other, ensuring they point to different memory locations.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 5
Pointers: disp[1][col] and v[i]
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: disp[1][col] and v[i] are allocated from different memory regions and are never assigned to each other, ensuring they never point to the same location.

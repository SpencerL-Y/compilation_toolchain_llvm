==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: b and w
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `Zulu` assigns `*p = q` and then `*p = obj`, which means `b` could potentially point to `w` or `obj`, leading to a possible aliasing scenario between `b` and `w`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &g
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `b` is assigned the value of `w` through the indirect assignment `*p = q` in function `Zulu`, and then `*p` is reassigned to `obj`, which points to `&g`. This creates a potential alias between `b` and `&g`.

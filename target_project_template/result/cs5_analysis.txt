Analysis Results - cs5
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a1 and b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `*g = q`, where `g` is set to `p` (which is `a`), and `q` is `b`. This means `*a` is assigned the value of `b`, making `a1` (pointed to by `a`) potentially point to the same location as `b`.

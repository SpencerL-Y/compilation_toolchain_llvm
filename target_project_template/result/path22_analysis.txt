Analysis Results - path22
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: a and b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pointers a and b are initialized to point to the same location, ADDRESS_OF[&c], and no operations in the program change this relationship.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: m and n
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `*x = y`, which means `*a` (or `*b`) is assigned the value of `q`, which is `&c`. Since `*a = m` and `n = *b`, `m` and `n` may alias if `*b` is assigned `m` through `foo`. The execution path and assignments allow for the possibility that `m` and `n` point to the same location.

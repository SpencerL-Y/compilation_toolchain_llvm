Analysis Results - ptr-dereference3
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s and &z
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the assignment `s = r`, and since `r` is initialized to the address of `z`, `s` and `&z` must alias as they both point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and r
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: After the assignment `s = r;`, both `s` and `r` point to the same location, and since `x = *y;` where `y` points to `r`, `x` must point to the same location as `r`.

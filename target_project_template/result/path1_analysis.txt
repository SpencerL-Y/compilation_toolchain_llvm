Analysis Results - path1
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: c and &e
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers c and &e are assigned in mutually exclusive branches of the if-else statement, ensuring they never point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: d and &f
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `d` and `&f` may be assigned to the same location through the function `foo`, which assigns `*p = q`. If the `else` branch is taken, `x` points to `d` and `y` points to `f`, leading to `d` potentially being assigned the address of `f`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: c and &f
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Depending on the execution path, `c` and `&f` may be assigned to the same location through the function `foo`, which assigns `*p = q`. If the `else` branch is taken, `x` points to `d` and `y` points to `f`, and `foo` assigns `d` to `f`, making `c` and `&f` potentially alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: d and &e
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers d and &e are assigned in mutually exclusive branches of the if-else statement, ensuring they never point to the same memory location.

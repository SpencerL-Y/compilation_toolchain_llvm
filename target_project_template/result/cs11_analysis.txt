==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and &q
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `b` to `*a`, making `p` point to `q` after the first call, ensuring they always point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and &y
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns `*a = b`, which means `x` may point to `&y` after the second call to `foo`, creating a potential alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: x and &q
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `x` and the address of `q` to `p`, and there are no operations that connect `x` and `&q`, so they never point to the same location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: p and &y
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The function `foo` assigns the address of `y` to `x`, and since `p` is assigned the address of `q` in a similar manner, `p` and `&y` may alias due to potential indirect assignments through `foo`.

==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: r and q
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `r` is assigned the value of `*b`, which may be `q` if the condition `if(a)` is true, leading to a potential aliasing between `r` and `q`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: r and &z
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: In the execution path where `a` is non-null, `f` is assigned the address of `z`, and `b` is updated to point to `g` through `*p`, which is then dereferenced to assign `r`. Thus, `r` may point to `z` depending on the execution path taken.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: r and &f1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional assignment of `f` to `&z` within the `if(a)` block, `r` may point to either `&f1` or `&z`, depending on the execution path, leading to a potential alias with `&f1`.

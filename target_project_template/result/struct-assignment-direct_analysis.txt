Analysis Results - struct-assignment-direct
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s2.a and s1.a
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The assignment `s2 = s1` copies the entire struct, including the pointer `s1.a`, to `s2.a`, so `s2.a` may point to the same location as `s1.a`.

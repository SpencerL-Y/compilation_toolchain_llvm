Analysis Results - pcycle2
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: c and &a
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `c` is indirectly assigned through `*a`, which is `&c`, and `*b` is assigned `&a`, creating a potential aliasing path between `c` and `&a`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: b and &c
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer `b` is assigned the address of `c` through the indirect assignment `*a = ADDRESS_OF[&c]`, and since `a` is assigned the address of `b`, `b` may point to `c`.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: a and &b
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Pointer 'a' is assigned the address of 'b', making 'a' point to 'b', not '&b', which is the address of 'b'.

Analysis Results - struct-incompab-typecast
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: pdst->f2 and &x
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: The pointer pdst->f2 is initially assigned the value of psrc->f2, which is set to point to &y. However, pdst is a type-cast of psrc, and due to the type-casting, pdst->f2 could potentially alias with psrc->f1, which points to &x. Therefore, pdst->f2 may alias with &x due to the type-casting and field sensitivity rules.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: pdst->f2 and &y
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: pdst is cast from psrc, and psrc->f2 is assigned the address of y, so pdst->f2 may alias with &y due to the struct field casting.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: psrc->f2 and &z
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different fields in a struct never alias, and psrc->f2 is assigned to &y, while pdst->f3 is assigned to &z, which are different memory locations.

Analysis Results - struct-onefld
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: &pint1->f1 and &pint2->f1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pint1 and pint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 's', so they must alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: &pint1->f1 and &s.f1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both pint1 and pint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 's', so &pint1->f1 and &s.f1 must alias as they point to the same memory location.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: &qint1->f1 and &qint2->f1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both qint1 and qint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 't', so their field accesses &qint1->f1 and &qint2->f1 must alias.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: &qint1->f1 and &t.f1
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: Both qint1 and qint2 are directly assigned the address of the same struct instance 't', making &qint1->f1 and &t.f1 point to the same memory location.

Analysis Results - array-constIdx
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f2
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias due to field sensitivity.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: The pointers s[0].f1 and s[1].f1 are assigned to the addresses of different variables (&a and &b, respectively), and since they are different fields in different struct instances, they never alias.

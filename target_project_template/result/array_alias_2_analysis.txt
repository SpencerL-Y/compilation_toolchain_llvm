Analysis Results - array_alias_2
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f1
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Although s[0].f1 and s[1].f1 are initialized to different addresses, the assignment within the conditional statement could make s[1].f1 point to the same address as s[0].f1, leading to potential aliasing.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: p[0] and s[1].f2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Both p[0] and s[1].f2 are assigned the address of variable 'c', and due to the conditional assignment of s[1].f1 to the address of 'c', there is a potential execution path where s[1].f2 could also be assigned the address of 'c', leading to a possible aliasing scenario.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 3
Pointers: s[0].f3 and &y
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different struct fields never alias, and s[0].f3 is assigned to &x, while &y is a separate float variable.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 4
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f2
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different fields in a struct never alias, and s[0].f1 and s[1].f2 are different fields in potentially different struct instances.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 5
Pointers: p[1] and s[1].f1
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: Due to the conditional assignment `s[1].f1 = &c` when `a` is true, both `p[1]` and `s[1].f1` may point to the same memory location `&d` or `&c`, depending on the execution path.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 6
Pointers: s[0].f1 and s[1].f2
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Different fields in a struct never alias, and s[0].f1 and s[1].f2 are different fields across different struct instances.

Analysis Results - function_pointer_2
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: p and q
Ground Truth: MUST
LLM Result: MUST
Reason: In the function `func1`, the assignment `*p = *q` ensures that the pointers `*p` and `*q` point to the same memory location, making `p` and `q` must-alias at LABEL 1.
--------------------------------------------------

Label: LABEL 2
Pointers: x and y
Ground Truth: NO
LLM Result: NO
Reason: Pointers x and y are initialized to point to different memory locations, &o1 and &o2 respectively, and there are no assignments or operations in the program that could cause them to alias.

Analysis Results - CI-funptr
==================================================

Label: LABEL 1
Pointers: m and n
Ground Truth: MAY
LLM Result: MAY
Reason: In the first call to `f(pa, pb)`, `m` points to `a` and `n` points to `b`, so they do not alias. However, in the second call `(*p)(pa, pb)`, both `m` and `n` point to `a`, creating a potential alias. Therefore, considering all execution paths, `m` and `n` may alias.
